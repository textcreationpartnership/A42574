            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE PREFACE.</head>
            <p>
               <hi>I</hi> Have been ſo much larger in my <hi>Vindication</hi> of the <hi>Primitive Fathers</hi> than I intended at firſt, that I would not have troubled the <hi>Reader</hi> with any Preface at all, but that I think it requiſite to give him ſome account of the length of it. In the preſent Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſy with the <hi>Writers</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> we lye un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der one great unhappineſs, which our <hi>Forefathers</hi> were not troubled with in their Contests with the <hi>Romaniſts;</hi> they were wont <hi>then</hi> fairly to own their Popiſh Doctrines, and our Authors had nothing to do but to oppoſe them: but we have not only the diſproving of Popery upon our hands <hi>now,</hi> but must be obliged alſo to prove the Popery it ſelf upon them: We must now not only prove the Worſhip of Images to be unlawful, but prove, that they worſhip Images.</p>
            <p>This is that which hath ingaged me to be ſo large, for the Adverſary I have to do with is one of the new Stamp, one of the Aſſertors of the <hi>NEW POPERY,</hi> who ſince they ſee they cannot defend the true old down-right Popery, have ſet up ſuch a Popery as they think they can defend. Thus when they find how perfectly inconſistent with the Honour of God, and how directly contrary to the Word of God it is to give Adoration or Religious Worſhip to <hi>Images</hi> or <hi>Reliques;</hi> they are for ſalving all by bearing the Reader in hand that they do not do it: and thus when we ſhew them that their <hi>Purgatory-Fire</hi> is not only inconſistent with the Account we have of the <hi>State</hi> of the <hi>Dead</hi> in the <hi>Holy Scriptures,</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:94813:3"/>but alſo with the Account of it in the <hi>Primitive Fathers</hi> for ſix hundred years, they have no other refuge than to tell us, that they do not hold a <hi>Fiery Purgatory.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This diſſembling and betraying of their own <hi>Popery</hi> is that which hath occaſion'd my inſisting ſo largely and distinctly upon theſe points, by which I have effectually ſhewn, that the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> doth command and practiſe the <hi>Adoration</hi> of <hi>Images</hi> and <hi>Reliques,</hi> and that her <hi>Purgatory</hi> differs only from <hi>Hell</hi> in the <hi>Duration</hi> of their <hi>Torments.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I did expect and hope I ſhall reap a double advantage from my care to expoſe theſe things; the first of which is to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fute my Adverſary, and the other to make it evident to the meanest Reader, how very unſincere the Repreſenter is in gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving us the true State of their Popery. I am ſure, that as to <hi>Purgatory,</hi> about which he took the most pains to defend himſelf, I have invincibly proved upon him, that <hi>he</hi> either did <hi>not underſtand</hi> the <hi>Doctrine</hi> of his own <hi>Church,</hi> or did most unfaithfully <hi>diſſemble</hi> it.</p>
            <p>I hope I need not trouble my ſelf to warn our People of the Confidence with which theſe <hi>Romiſh Writers</hi> can write the most falſe and most diſingenuous things: if <hi>Confidence</hi> be all that is neceſſary to carry any cauſe, I must confeſs that we ſhould come off loſers, becauſe we cannot tell how to imitate theſe men: however no one is ignorant that a <hi>Mountebank</hi> is but a <hi>Mountebank</hi> still for all his pretending to Infallible Cures, to never-failing Remedies.</p>
            <p>But we must allow our Adverſaries this Aſſurance, ſince they have nothing elſe to ſet off or recommend their <hi>Cauſe,</hi> excepting <hi>that</hi> which is a conſequence of it, their writing with a Contempt of us, and treating us ſcurrilouſly; but this we can bear chearfully enough, tho' reproach is uneaſy to Mankind, becauſe it does ſo plainly ſpeak out, that all Scho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar-like Arguments are ſpent, and that they have no other left to encounter us with.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:94813:3"/>
            <p>Of this we have had a great deal of late, and I have had my ſhare from them; I will not animadvert further on it than to ſay, that their <hi>late Pamphlets</hi> against us are ſo <hi>very abuſive,</hi> as if they had been <hi>Written</hi> as well as <hi>Printed</hi> by <hi>the Ditch-ſide.</hi> I do heartily forgive them, and believe all our <hi>Writers</hi> do, and deſire to make no other return to ſuch Treatment, than to offer up hearty Prayers to <hi>God,</hi> That <hi>He would bring into the way of Truth all thoſe who have erred and are deceived,</hi> and that <hi>He</hi> would frustrate the <hi>Devices</hi> of <hi>them,</hi> who are endeavouring <hi>to deceive others.</hi>

               <p>But upon ſecond thoughts I ſuppoſe it was, that my
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:94813:6"/>
                  <hi>Adverſaries</hi> found it would be their beſt way to treat me as a <hi>Writer,</hi> and that it muſt be their care to have ſome ſort of an <hi>Anſwer</hi> made to thoſe ſevere things I had charged the <hi>Repreſenter</hi> and the <hi>Jeſuit</hi> with.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Jeſuit Sabran</hi> was the <hi>firſt</hi> that took the Field againſt me, and reaſon good; ſince he had but a ſmall <hi>Poſtſcript</hi> of <hi>half a page</hi> to encounter; and therefore after <hi>three Weeks</hi> time from the publiſhing of the <hi>Poſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcript</hi> at the <hi>end</hi> of <hi>my Anſwer</hi> to the <hi>Nubes Teſtium,</hi> out comes <hi>his Letter</hi> of a Sheet and a half to a <hi>Proteſtant Lord</hi> in defence of the <hi>Paſſage</hi> in <hi>his Printed Sermon,</hi> which I had reflected on.</p>
               <p>Aſſoon as I ſaw <hi>his Letter,</hi> I could not but ſmile to ſee them begin at the wrong end of my <hi>Book</hi> to anſwer it, and to ſee them withal undertake the <hi>Defence</hi> of that thing, in which they were oppoſed not only by us <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants,</hi> but by <hi>all</hi> the <hi>Men</hi> of <hi>Learning</hi> in their <hi>own Church:</hi> and therefore I needed not to be much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned, ſince I perceived I was engaged with an <hi>Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary</hi> whom I might anſwer as faſt as I could write, who, inſtead of acquitting himſelf fairly of the <hi>firſt</hi> and <hi>ſingle charge</hi> againſt <hi>him,</hi> had blundered ignorantly into ſeveral other miſtakes; which I reſolved to call him to account for, and therefore immediately I wrote him an Anſwer, and got it diſpatcht ſo ſuddenly at the Preſs, that there was but <hi>one day</hi> betwixt the publiſhing of his <hi>Letter</hi> to the <hi>Proteſtant Lord,</hi> and <hi>my Letter</hi> to the <hi>Jeſuit himſelf</hi> in <hi>Anſwer</hi> to it.</p>
               <p>Whether the <hi>ſuddenneſs</hi> of my <hi>Reply,</hi> or the diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering to the World of his further miſtakes, was the reaſon of his <hi>paſſionate Reply,</hi> I cannot tell; however I wondered to ſee a <hi>Jeſuit</hi> who wrote with ſo much tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per in the <hi>firſt Letter,</hi> and reſolved not to be provoked into inſulting or ſcurrilous Language, quite forget <hi>him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf</hi> in the <hi>Reply</hi> he made to my <hi>firſt Letter;</hi> and in <hi>this
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:94813:6"/>Reply</hi> which <hi>he</hi> publiſhed within leſs than a Week after his ſo ſolemn profeſſions unto the contrary to the <hi>Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant Lord,</hi> to fall into ſuch indecent heats and ſuch ſcurri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous language: but I can aſſure <hi>him,</hi> I was not moved by it, and did as little mind as I did little deſerve ſuch impertinent language from <hi>him:</hi> All my concern was to ſend him a <hi>ſecond Letter,</hi> and to let him know that I was reſolved to make his Ignorance as apparent to the World, as his Sermon had been, and to expoſe his confident miſtakes and his bold untruths about the <hi>four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth</hi> and <hi>eighteenth</hi> as well as the <hi>thirty fifth Sermons</hi> of St. <hi>Auſtin de Sanctis.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I did in two days diſpatch and print, and the next day ſent him my <hi>ſecond Letter;</hi> to which I have not ſince received one word of <hi>Anſwer,</hi> and I ſuppoſe I ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſhall; and I think that <hi>Jeſuit</hi> is by this time con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinc'd that it had been better for <hi>him</hi> to have ſat down at firſt quietly under the reproof given him in the <hi>Poſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcript</hi> to the <hi>Anſwer</hi> to the <hi>Nubes Teſtium:</hi> ſince <hi>he</hi> hath by his vain attempt to vindicate <hi>himſelf,</hi> betrayed his Ignorance and his weakneſs ſo very much to the World, and his <hi>Anſwerer</hi> hath not omitted (in the <hi>ſecond Letter</hi> eſpecially, wherein <hi>he</hi> had more room) to expoſe and publiſh it to the World, and to convince <hi>all Readers</hi> what ſort of <hi>Adverſaries</hi> we deal with at preſent.</p>
               <p>I thought my ſelf obliged to make ſuch a diſcovery of this <hi>Jeſuit</hi> to the World, becauſe I did underſtand while I was engaged with him, that he does appear wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully great in his own Eyes, and was as deſirous of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thought a very terrible <hi>Jeſuit</hi> to the People in <hi>Wales,</hi> when <hi>he</hi> went thither, not long ſince, filled with the deſign and pleaſing thoughts of bringing in the <hi>Welſh Nation</hi> by ſhoals into the Boſom of the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi>'s Church: but I queſtion not but before this time that Country hath another very different Idea of <hi>him</hi> and
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:94813:7"/>his Learning; and that they now ſee that his Ignorance is altogether as great, as the Confidence with which he appeared and made ſuch bluſtering among them.</p>
               <p>While I was thus engaged with <hi>Sabran</hi> the <hi>Jeſuit,</hi> the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſenter,</hi> or the <hi>Compiler</hi> of the <hi>Nubes Teſtium</hi> (for <hi>he</hi> that wrote <hi>Popery miſrepreſented and repreſented,</hi> is the ſame Perſon that ſtole the <hi>Nubes Teſtium</hi> out of <hi>Natalis Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>andre</hi>) had got ſomething ready againſt <hi>me,</hi> and was willing to be the <hi>Jeſuit</hi>'s <hi>Second:</hi> that they might there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore divert me from medling any further with the <hi>Jeſuit,</hi> who, they could not but ſee, had grievouſly overſhot himſelf, and yet if poſſible, was to make ſome ſort of a creditable retreat; the ſame day that the <hi>Jeſuit</hi> pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed his <hi>Reply</hi> to my <hi>first Letter,</hi> the <hi>Repreſenter</hi> alſo appeared in Print againſt <hi>me,</hi> but in <hi>Maſquerade,</hi> leſt it ſhould look a little ungenerous, to fall <hi>two</hi> of <hi>them,</hi> and two ſuch men of wonderful proweſs and skill, at the ſame inſtant upon one <hi>weak</hi> and <hi>unskilful Writer,</hi> if you will believe the <hi>Repreſenter:</hi> and as if he had been <hi>Secretary</hi> to a <hi>Committee</hi> of <hi>Diſſenters,</hi> and had Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders to draw up <hi>Articles</hi> of <hi>Popery</hi> againſt <hi>me,</hi> he pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhes from <hi>his Masters</hi> a <hi>Letter from a Diſſenter to the Divines of the Church of England,</hi> wherein I am com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained of for no fewer than <hi>ſixteen Articles</hi> of <hi>Popery</hi> to be found in <hi>my Anſwer</hi> to the <hi>Compiler</hi> of <hi>the Nubes Testium.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But I did no ſooner ſee this <hi>pretended Letter</hi> from a <hi>Diſſenter,</hi> than I was ſatisfied, not only of the <hi>deſign,</hi> but of the <hi>Author</hi> of <hi>it,</hi> and to ſpoil the deſign I imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately ſet to anſwering the <hi>Jeſuit,</hi> that ſo I might put an effectual end to the <hi>Controverſie</hi> with him, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by be wholly at leiſure to attend my <hi>new Adverſary</hi> in diſguiſe. I was not deceived in my intentions, for af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the ſending <hi>him</hi> my <hi>ſecond Letter,</hi> I have not heard one word of the <hi>Jeſuit</hi> ſince, and now after above <hi>ſix
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:94813:7"/>Weeks</hi> expectations I think I may have leave to believe that I have done his buſineſs, and have wholly rid my hands of the <hi>Jeſuit.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And leſt the <hi>Repreſenter</hi> ſhould think I ſhould deſpiſe <hi>him,</hi> becauſe I might not know him in his <hi>Diſſenter</hi>'s <hi>Maſque,</hi> and that I ſhould diſdain to vindicate my ſelf againſt ſuch a <hi>falſe</hi> and <hi>groundleſs Charge,</hi> I was careful in an <hi>Advertiſement</hi> at the <hi>End</hi> of my <hi>Second Letter</hi> which I was ſending to <hi>his Friend</hi> the <hi>Jeſuit,</hi> to let him and the World underſtand that I knew him notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding his Diſguiſe, and that I intended to give him a <hi>ſpeedy Anſwer</hi> to that pitiful cheat.</p>
               <p>I was as good as my word, and did ſhortly after pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh my <hi>Vindication</hi> againſt the <hi>Popiſh-Diſſenter</hi>'s <hi>Letter,</hi> wherein I ſhewed the great Knavery, the intolerable diſingenuity and frequent Calumnies and Falſifications up and down that <hi>Letter,</hi> by which I am ſatisfied that I did ſufficiently acquit my ſelf, and that if the <hi>Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenter</hi> himſelf be not, yet the World is convinced, that he ought to be aſhamed of ſuch mean and contemptible projects of defaming an <hi>Adverſary;</hi> that <hi>he</hi> had much better never to have medled with ſuch a knaviſh Prank, as that <hi>pretended Letter</hi> was, ſince this piece of knavery had the fate that attends all ſuch unlawful and diſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genuous actions, to do the <hi>Repreſenter</hi> and his <hi>Cauſe,</hi> now it is diſplayed, ten times more miſchief, than it e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver could have done him ſervice, had <hi>it</hi> continued (as he doubtleſs hoped it would) concealed; for I can aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure the <hi>Repreſenter</hi> that I do not ſpeak my own Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but that of abundance of people who are <hi>competent Judges</hi> of theſe things, and of a great many <hi>worthy</hi> and <hi>Honourable Perſons</hi> too, if I tell <hi>him,</hi> that <hi>he</hi> hath by that diſſembling Practice quite ſunk his Reputation, and is now and will be looked upon as a <hi>Perſon</hi> of <hi>no Honeſty,</hi> nor <hi>Conſcience:</hi> and this I hope will at laſt convince the
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:94813:8"/>
                  <hi>Repreſenter himſelf,</hi> that the publiſhing of that <hi>pretended Letter</hi> hath coſt him very dear, hath forfeited <hi>that thing</hi> which every good and honeſt man values next to his <hi>Life.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I thought it not improper to give this <hi>State</hi> of the <hi>Controverſie</hi> betwixt <hi>me</hi> and the <hi>Romiſh Jeſuit</hi> and <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſenter</hi> in relation to that <hi>Anſwer</hi> to the <hi>Nubes Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um,</hi> which hath been the <hi>Cauſe</hi> of all the diſpute be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt <hi>us,</hi> ſince <hi>it</hi> was publiſhed unto the World, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially ſince <hi>thoſe two Perſons will</hi> be ſo much concerned in <hi>this Book,</hi> which I am now writing: and it cannot be ungrateful to the <hi>Reader</hi> to know the <hi>Characters</hi> of <hi>them,</hi> particularly of the <hi>Repreſenter,</hi> who hath made ſo much noiſe in the World, and is the Perſon againſt <hi>whom</hi> this <hi>Anſwer</hi> of mine is chiefly aimed.</p>
               <p>For within ſome time after the publiſhing of his <hi>Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter from a Diſſenter to the Divines of the Church of</hi> England againſt <hi>me, he</hi> was pleaſed to lay aſide his <hi>Fanatical Maſque,</hi> and to publiſh to the World in his own Name a formal <hi>Vindication</hi> of his <hi>Nubes Testium</hi> with the pom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pous Title of <hi>The Primitive Fathers no Proteſtants, or a Vindication of</hi> Nubes Teſtium <hi>from the Cavils of the Anſwerer.</hi>

               <p>Aſſoon as his Book was brought to my hands, and I had caſt my Eye on his <hi>Title-page,</hi> I began to ſuſpect that now <hi>he</hi> had ſtolen from his <hi>own dear ſelf,</hi> and that we ſhould now be ſerved up again with his 11<hi rend="sup">th</hi>, 12<hi rend="sup">th</hi>, 13<hi rend="sup">th</hi>, and 14<hi rend="sup">th</hi> 
                  <hi>Chapters</hi> of his <hi>Second Part</hi> of a <hi>Papiſt Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>repreſented and Repreſented,</hi> which is no new thing with him; but upon the <hi>Peruſal</hi> of his <hi>Book,</hi> I found that <hi>this Title</hi> was only for Ornament ſake, to help his <hi>Printer</hi> in the Sale of <hi>them,</hi> or to uſe <hi>one</hi> of his own dearly beloved Elegancies, that this <hi>Title</hi> is much like his <hi>Bartholomew-Fair-Narrative at the outſide of a Booth,</hi> of which he gives ſuch a <hi>Critical Account</hi> in the <hi>first
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:94813:8"/>page</hi> of his <hi>Preface</hi> to <hi>his Third Part of Popery Miſrepreſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and Repreſented,</hi> as would make one ſuſpect that the <hi>Repreſenter</hi> uſes to be very converſant at <hi>that Fair,</hi> and that <hi>he</hi> there pickt up <hi>moſt</hi> of thoſe <hi>pretty Phraſes,</hi> and <hi>fine Elegancies</hi> which appear up and down his <hi>Pamphlets,</hi> and ſet them off ſo very much to the <hi>Generality</hi> of his credulous <hi>Readers.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Well, but tho' the <hi>Repreſenter</hi> did not formally ſet himſelf to ſhew that the <hi>Primitive Fathers</hi> were <hi>no Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants,</hi> yet did he not do it effectually enough in <hi>vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicating</hi> his <hi>Nubes Teſtium</hi> throughly from the <hi>Cavils</hi> of the <hi>Anſwerer?</hi> this I know is that <hi>he</hi> will value himſelf upon, and therefore I come next to examine whether, and how he hath done that.</p>
               <p>I muſt confeſs that when I ſaw his <hi>Title</hi> ſo promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing and his <hi>Pamphlet</hi> ſo ſmall, I did expect that he would have kept cloſe to his <hi>Vindication,</hi> and would have come up fairly to <hi>me</hi> in <hi>every point</hi> and <hi>charge;</hi> but when I came to read him, I found him ſpending <hi>page</hi> after <hi>page</hi> in <hi>general diſcourſe</hi> nothing to the purpoſe, and roving here and there, firſt into <hi>Oats</hi>'s <hi>Plot,</hi> then quickly into the <hi>Pulpits,</hi> then back into the <hi>defence,</hi> no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but rambling and incoherent Diſcourſe, as if his buſineſs had been not to give a <hi>fair anſwer</hi> to an <hi>Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſary,</hi> but to fill up <hi>ſix ſheets</hi> of <hi>paper</hi> with <hi>ſomething.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>After I heard of his <hi>Intentions</hi> of vindicating the <hi>Nubes,</hi> I did not wonder to find ſuch rambling ſtuff in <hi>his Book,</hi> for I very well knew his Ignorance was ſo great that it would be impoſſible for <hi>him</hi> to do it as it did require: the collecting of the <hi>Nubes</hi> out of <hi>Natalis Alexandre,</hi> is no more than what might have been done by a <hi>Bookſeller</hi>'s <hi>Apprentice,</hi> who brought ſo much learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with him from School, as to be able to underſtand a <hi>Latin Author,</hi> and to tranſlate ſome paſſages of him into <hi>Engliſh:</hi> But to defend <hi>thoſe paſſages,</hi> and to prove
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:94813:9"/>
                  <hi>they</hi> were not <hi>curtail'd,</hi> nor <hi>abuſed,</hi> nor <hi>miſunderſtood,</hi> nor <hi>miſapplied,</hi> did require a <hi>knowledge</hi> and <hi>skill</hi> in the <hi>Writings</hi> of the <hi>Fathers themſelves</hi> out of whom <hi>they</hi> had been borrowed, and therefore the <hi>Repreſenter</hi> was <hi>here</hi> at a loſs, was carried beyond his depth, and was hereby ingaged in <hi>Matters</hi> he knew nothing more of than what <hi>he</hi> found in his <hi>Maſter Natalis Alexandre,</hi> who not foreſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing what anſwers would be made to his <hi>ſeveral quotati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> out of the <hi>Fathers</hi> could not ſet down his <hi>Defences</hi> of <hi>them,</hi> and therefore could not ſupply the <hi>Repreſenter</hi> in <hi>this Emergency,</hi> wherein <hi>he</hi> was ſo hard put to it by his <hi>Adverſary.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Yet notwithſtanding all this, the <hi>Repreſenter</hi> plucks up a good heart, and what <hi>he</hi> wanted of <hi>Learning</hi> for this occaſion, he ſeems reſolved to make up with <hi>Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,</hi> and therefore talks with as much aſſurance in his <hi>Vindication,</hi> as if <hi>he</hi> had the <hi>Fathers</hi> at his Fingers ends, and was reſolved to carry the World before <hi>him;</hi> but ſince he was ſo hardy as to venture once more into the Combat, I think it fit to make up to <hi>him,</hi> and to let him know that I muſt ſtop him a while, that we two may fairly and calmly examine what hath been written and ſaid on both ſides, and ſee whether things have been managed betwixt <hi>us,</hi> as might be expected from <hi>thoſe</hi> who underſtood what <hi>they</hi> were about, and had no other deſign than to make <hi>Truth</hi> appear, which all men will be ready enough to follow.</p>
               <p>At the <hi>end</hi> of <hi>his Book he</hi> tells his <hi>Reader</hi> he hath run through all the <hi>Sections of his Anſwerer but one,</hi> and talks as if <hi>he</hi> had been as <hi>particular</hi> and as <hi>ſubſtantial</hi> in his <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies</hi> as any <hi>Reader</hi> could deſire; but to let the World ſee the bold diſingenuity of this <hi>Repreſenter,</hi> and to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>play his Confidence and his Ignorance alike, I muſt take a <hi>new method</hi> with ſuch a <hi>pretender,</hi> and let the World ſee how much of <hi>my Book</hi> he hath not ſaid one
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:94813:9"/>word to in <hi>defence</hi> of the <hi>Nubes:</hi> his dexterity at drop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping the <hi>defence</hi> of his <hi>thirty ſeven Chapters</hi> of his <hi>Popery Miſrepreſented and Repreſented</hi> hath been very well ſhewn in the <hi>View of the whole Controverſie betwixt him and the Anſwerer;</hi> but ſuch things cannot put him to the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence of but <hi>one bluſh:</hi> for in his <hi>Preface</hi> to his <hi>laſt Piece of Popery Miſrepreſented and Repreſented he</hi> ſtands to it, that as for the <hi>Miſrepreſentations</hi> no body can prove that <hi>he had not ſuch apprehenſions of Popery</hi> while <hi>he</hi> was a <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant;</hi> And for the <hi>Repreſentations,</hi> no body can prove that <hi>he</hi> did not therein give <hi>that account</hi> of <hi>Popery which he had learnt in ſixteen years Converſation</hi> among the <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts;</hi> and thinks this anſwer ſufficient, and a very good reaſon why he needed not to diſpute: but the World is by this time ſatisfied, that there is a <hi>better reaſon</hi> why he did not diſpute and defend <hi>his Characters,</hi> which is, becauſe he had not learning enough to do it.</p>
               <p>And this perhaps will be his <hi>next anſwer</hi> to <hi>me,</hi> that in the <hi>Nubes Teſtium he</hi> did only <hi>repreſent</hi> the <hi>Fathers Doctrine</hi> and <hi>Opinions,</hi> as <hi>he</hi> had learnt <hi>them</hi> in <hi>Natalis Alexandre,</hi> and <hi>other Catholick Writers:</hi> but I will take care to ſhut up that Door, by letting <hi>him</hi> know, that if <hi>he</hi> quote the <hi>Fathers themſelves,</hi> and either falſify, or miſapply, or curtail <hi>their words,</hi> no man elſe is to be an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerable for <hi>them</hi> but <hi>himſelf,</hi> and that herein <hi>he</hi> is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>evitably put upon <hi>defending</hi> what <hi>he</hi> hath quoted, and <hi>diſputing</hi> that ſuch and ſuch is the <hi>true ſenſe</hi> of the <hi>words,</hi> and the <hi>doctrine</hi> of <hi>ſuch</hi> or <hi>ſuch</hi> a <hi>Father.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And therefore ſince I was ſo very particular in <hi>my Anſwer</hi> to the <hi>Nubes Teſtium</hi> as to follow him from paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage to paſſage, and to ſhew <hi>him</hi> that <hi>ſuch</hi> and <hi>ſuch paſſages</hi> were nothing to the purpoſe, that <hi>others</hi> were falſified, that a <hi>third ſort</hi> were miſunderſtood, and wretchedly miſapplied, and gave my reaſons and Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments for it all along; <hi>He ought</hi> either to have been
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:94813:10"/>as particular and fair in <hi>his Vindication;</hi> or ſince he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally was unable to do it, to have got <hi>ſome Friends</hi> to have done it for <hi>him;</hi> but <hi>he</hi> is for doing all himſelf, and thinks, I warrant <hi>him,</hi> that <hi>his Vindication</hi> will paſs well enough upon the <hi>Generality</hi> of <hi>Readers,</hi> ſince it is writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten with an air of Confidence, and with ſuch an aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance as certainly perſuades the <hi>Readers,</hi> that he has the Truth on his ſide.</p>
               <p>And therefore I think the greater obligation is upon me to expoſe ſuch an affected confidence, and I muſt beg the <hi>Reader</hi>'s pardon if I begin a <hi>tedious</hi> but <hi>new Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod</hi> to clear this to the World, and ſhew theſe <hi>two things.</hi> Firſt a <hi>Catalogue</hi> of abundance of <hi>material points</hi> and <hi>arguments</hi> in my <hi>Book,</hi> to which <hi>he</hi> hath offered no ſort of Anſwer. Secondly, The <hi>Weakneſs</hi> and <hi>Vanity</hi> of all that <hi>he</hi> hath ſaid in <hi>Anſwer</hi> to any parts of <hi>my Book.</hi> The clearing of <hi>theſe two things</hi> will give a <hi>full Anſwer</hi> to his <hi>pretended Vindication,</hi> and will alſo, I do not doubt it, put a full End to the <hi>Controverſie</hi> about the <hi>Nubes Teſtium,</hi> betwixt the <hi>Repreſenter</hi> and <hi>Me.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As to the <hi>Catalogue</hi> therefore, I will place the <hi>ſeveral particulars</hi> as they lye in the <hi>diſtinct Chapters</hi> and <hi>Sections</hi> of <hi>my Anſwer,</hi> but muſt begin with my <hi>Preface,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in I charged him in the <hi>firſt place</hi> with affirming not only what was <hi>falſe,</hi> but what was more than <hi>he</hi> could know, to wit, that <hi>the Latin of his Nubes Teſtium</hi> was out of <hi>ſuch Editions as are moſt authentick;</hi> ſince I ſhewed it to be falſe from <hi>N. Alexandre</hi>'s <hi>own Confeſſion;</hi> and that he could not know what <hi>Editions N. Alexandre</hi> did uſe, becauſe <hi>N. Alexandre</hi> does not tell the <hi>Readers</hi> what <hi>Editions he</hi> uſed in <hi>his Work,</hi> excepting <hi>Chriſtopherſon</hi>'s <hi>Edition</hi> of <hi>Euſebius,</hi> which all know to be far from being the <hi>moſt authentick.</hi> To this ſevere Charge he gives no Reply.</p>
               <pb n="11" facs="tcp:94813:10"/>
               <p>I charged him alſo in the <hi>Preface</hi> with ſtealing the <hi>whole</hi> of his <hi>Nubes Teſtium</hi> (excepting a paſſage or two) out of <hi>N. Alexandre.</hi> This is not denied by him; and reaſon good, ſince <hi>every page</hi> of <hi>my Book</hi> did invincibly prove it; which hath ſo much enraged him againſt me. I charged him with ſtealing <hi>his Book</hi> out of a <hi>forbidden Author,</hi> every <hi>one of whoſe Volumes</hi> uſed by <hi>him</hi> in that <hi>Plagium</hi> had been condemned to the Flames by <hi>this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Pope</hi> two years before, and with his ſtanding <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicate</hi> by <hi>this Pope</hi> for his pains. This he durſt not deny any more than the other, ſince I had reprin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the <hi>Pope</hi>'s <hi>Bull</hi> it ſelf, by which <hi>thoſe Books</hi> were condemned, and the <hi>Repreſenter</hi> for keeping and uſing them Excommunicated by <hi>this preſent Pope.</hi>

               <p>But perceiving that all this would not clear <hi>him,</hi> or remove the Imputation of a <hi>very great Plagiary,</hi> under which he lay, he puts as good a face as <hi>he</hi> can upon the matter, and now is for aſſuring <hi>his Reader,</hi> that <hi>he</hi> is <hi>ſo far from being offended in being thought</hi> [he ſhould have added, and <hi>being proved</hi>] <hi>a Compiler, that he ſhould have thought himſelf unwiſe, if he had done more than compil'd.</hi> This is pleaſant ſtuff, and ſhews what metal ſome men

               <p>For <hi>firſt</hi> as to his ſaying, I have <hi>cut off two of the five Centuries,</hi> and only inſiſt on their being not able to ſhew, <hi>that Invocation of Saints was practis'd in the Firſt Three Centuries,</hi> it is very falſe: I neither cut off <hi>two</hi> of the <hi>five,</hi> nor inſiſted upon the <hi>three firſt Centuries only,</hi> but ſaid in that <hi>very page</hi> and <hi>place</hi> quoted by the <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piler,</hi> that <hi>I would paſs on to Invocation of Saints,</hi> and <hi>ſee whether the Compiler did ſhew this to have been the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of the Three firſt Centuries, and ſo on:</hi> does <hi>and ſo on</hi> here ſignifie nothing?

               <p>Speaking in defence of the <hi>Church of England</hi>'s not <hi>practiſing Invocation of Saints,</hi> I have theſe <hi>very expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; We have far more reaſon to reject Invocation and ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn Prayers to Saints as Superſtitious, ſince it is againſt Scripture, and againſt the Practice of the Three firſt Centu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,</hi> AGAINST A COUNCIL <hi>in the</hi> FOURTH CENTU<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>RY,

               <p>With what face then could <hi>this man</hi> write that <hi>I had given up the fourth and fifth Centuries?</hi> Who can believe that <hi>ſuch men</hi> have in reality either <hi>Religion</hi> or <hi>Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,</hi> that can with ſo <hi>much deliberation</hi> commit ſuch a <hi>deliberate wrong?</hi> Had he had any regard to Truth or Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſty, his Conſcience muſt have flown into his Face, and told him, that what he was then writing was a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry great injuſtice, and directly falſe.

               <p>But to return, the only excuſe that can be made for <hi>him</hi> is, that <hi>he</hi> was neceſſitated to it; for as to the <hi>three firſt Centuries he</hi> found there was no manner of <hi>defence</hi> to be made for <hi>their Invocation of Saints</hi> thence, and that if I did not grant <hi>him</hi> that the <hi>fourth</hi> or <hi>fifth Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tury</hi> practiſed <hi>Invocation</hi> of <hi>Saints, he</hi> ſhould have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to ſay for <hi>his Church,</hi> or <hi>his Book, as</hi> to <hi>thoſe five hundred years which</hi> in the <hi>Title</hi> of <hi>his Nubes Teſtium</hi> he had appealed, and pretended to. <hi>He was</hi> forc'd there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, ſince I neither did grant him, nor could do it, to ſet the beſt Face he could upon the matter; and to ſay, <hi>I had granted that Invocation of Saints was the Practice of the Fourth and Fifth Centuries.</hi>

               <p>I have traced hitherto the <hi>Practice</hi> of the <hi>Primitive Church</hi> through the <hi>Five Firſt Centuries;</hi> I have inſiſted chiefly upon <hi>thoſe Authors</hi> and <hi>Books</hi> which preſent us with the <hi>Liturgies,</hi> which are doubtleſs the <hi>beſt</hi> and <hi>on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Evidences</hi> of the <hi>Practice</hi> of the <hi>Primitive Church</hi> for <hi>thoſe Ages.</hi> I have not inſiſted upon the <hi>Practice</hi> of particular Perſons, excepting thoſe two glorious and moſt conſpicuous <hi>Martyrs,</hi> S. <hi>Ignatius</hi> and S. <hi>Polycarp,</hi> whoſe Prayers I queſtion not were wholly conformed to the <hi>Publick Services</hi> in the <hi>Churches</hi> in <hi>their time:</hi> Had I done the <hi>ſame</hi> concerning the <hi>other Martyrs</hi> of the <hi>firſt</hi> and <hi>later Ages</hi> that I did about <hi>them two,</hi> or had I been careful to urge the <hi>Practice</hi> of <hi>particular Perſons</hi> apparent in their <hi>own writings,</hi> I muſt have tranſcribed a great part of the <hi>ancient Martyrologies,</hi> where we find all the <hi>Prayers</hi> of <hi>thoſe Martyrs</hi> addreſſed to <hi>God;</hi> and muſt have filled too many <hi>Pages</hi> with the <hi>Inſtances</hi> of other parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular <hi>Perſons</hi> and <hi>Writers.</hi>

               <p>If <hi>this Father</hi> was ſo very earneſt againſt any <hi>Invoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> of <hi>Angels,</hi> we have reaſon to believe, that upon his own reaſons urged above <hi>againſt placing any Truſt in</hi> MAN, <hi>he</hi> was as poſitive, if not much more againſt <hi>Invocation</hi> of <hi>Saints,</hi> ſince according to <hi>him,</hi> the <hi>Angels</hi> who are ſo conſtantly employed in the affairs of men, cannot but ſee and underſtand our wants; whereas the <hi>Saints,</hi> according to <hi>Him, know nothing of us,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore cannot be <hi>Invocated</hi> by us, except we are reſolved to throw away our <hi>Prayers,</hi> and to pray to <hi>thoſe</hi> who do not hear us.

                  <hi>That we muſt acknowledge, that the Dead are ignorant of what is done here upon earth;</hi> He had juſt before <hi>this Concluſion</hi> argued, that if the <hi>dead</hi> had any knowledge of things on earth, he ſhould not have wanted the conſtant aſſiſtance of his <hi>dear Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Monica</hi> in his troubles: and that if (as the <hi>Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures</hi> aſſure us) the <hi>Patriarchs themſelves</hi> were ignorant of <hi>their Poſterity,</hi> and knew nothing of the Condition good or bad of the <hi>People of Iſrael:</hi> we have a great deal of reaſon to conclude, that <hi>all the Dead</hi> were in the <hi>ſame Condition.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This certainly was that <hi>Father's Opinion,</hi> and this <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine</hi> I am ſure is perfectly inconſiſtent with <hi>Invocation</hi> of <hi>Saints,</hi> ſince it takes away the <hi>very foundation</hi> it ſelf on which <hi>Invocation</hi> is built, to wit, that the <hi>Dead do know our wants,</hi> and do hear us, and are able to relieve us. I will conclude the <hi>Teſtimonies</hi> upon <hi>this Head</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <hi>Invocation</hi> of <hi>Saints</hi> with that <hi>ſevere queſtion</hi> which <hi>Hilary</hi> the <hi>Deacon</hi> put to thoſe who were wont to wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip the <hi>Elements, becauſe they believed that the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment or Patronage of mens lives was intruſted with them.

               </p>
               <p>It is but altering a few words in this paſſage, and we may put the ſame queſtion to the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> about their <hi>Invocation</hi> and <hi>worſhip</hi> of <hi>Saints.</hi> We require to know, whether their <hi>Invocation of Saints</hi> be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded and appointed by <hi>God;</hi> for if <hi>Invocation</hi> of <hi>Saints</hi> ought to be practiſed, it ought to be commanded by <hi>him</hi> who made them Saints: but if it is <hi>no where</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded by <hi>him, Invocation</hi> of <hi>Saints</hi> is a PRESUMPTION, and will bring a Puniſhment on their Heads that pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe it, ſince it is a Contempt and affront to God to have his Servants made ſharers with him in his WOR<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SHIP.</p>
               <p>Thus I have gone through the <hi>Doctrine</hi> of the <hi>Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Fathers</hi> down to St. <hi>Auſtin</hi>'s time in the <hi>Fifth Age</hi> of the <hi>Church,</hi> and have found their <hi>Doctrine</hi> to be like their <hi>Practice:</hi> we had no reaſon to expect to meet with any <hi>Practice</hi> of <hi>Invocation</hi> of <hi>Saints</hi> or <hi>Angels</hi> in their days, ſince we find their <hi>Doctrines</hi> ſo fully and ſo unanimouſly againſt any ſuch thing; I am not conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to my ſelf of having either curtail'd, or miſapply'd, or perverted <hi>one</hi> of all the paſſages I have produced out of the <hi>Fathers</hi> of the <hi>Five Centuries;</hi> I hope the Reader hath carried them in his memory, that ſo he may help
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:94813:37"/>me to compare them with what <hi>Sabran</hi> the <hi>Jeſuit</hi> had the Aſſurance in both <hi>his Letters</hi> to ſay concerning St. <hi>Auſtin,</hi> and the <hi>Fathers</hi> of <hi>his</hi> and the <hi>precedent Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tury,</hi> that <hi>Invocation of Saints was taught by S.</hi> Auſtin, <hi>and</hi> ALL <hi>the Fathers of his Age, and the Precedent Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tury.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And is all this certainly true? Yes ſurely, or elſe the <hi>Jeſuit</hi> would have ſcorn'd to have aſſerted it ſo boldly in both <hi>his Letters:</hi> but alas, it will not prove ſo, ſince what I have collected out of the <hi>Fathers</hi> of the <hi>Fourth</hi> and <hi>Fifth Centuries</hi> will prove this to be a ſcandalous falſhood; for to argue the matter a little with <hi>him,</hi> did S. <hi>Athanaſius</hi> teach <hi>Invocation</hi> of <hi>Saints,</hi> who tells us, that <hi>no good Chriſtian</hi> ever prayed to <hi>Angels,</hi> or <hi>any other Creatures</hi> (of which number are the <hi>Saints</hi>) together with <hi>God,</hi> who proves the <hi>Divinity</hi> of our <hi>Saviour</hi> from his being <hi>Invocated?</hi> did <hi>Hilary</hi> the <hi>Deacon</hi> teach <hi>Invo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation</hi> of <hi>Saints,</hi> who does ſo very well expoſe the <hi>very ground</hi> of <hi>Invocation</hi> of going to <hi>God</hi> by the <hi>Saints,</hi> and ridicules the <hi>Compariſon</hi> drawn from <hi>Addreſſes</hi> made to <hi>Temporal Princes</hi> by the mediation of their Officers, and ſhews, that the compariſon is groundleſs, ſince <hi>Tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Princes</hi> are forc'd to make uſe of <hi>their Officers</hi> in ſuch things, becauſe they are but men, whereas <hi>God</hi> knows the <hi>Merits</hi> of <hi>all men,</hi> and therefore no need of a <hi>Spokes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man to him?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Did S. <hi>Baſil</hi> or <hi>Gregory Nyſſen</hi> teach <hi>Invocation,</hi> or a <hi>Praying</hi> to <hi>Saints,</hi> who define <hi>Prayer</hi> to be a <hi>Requeſt for ſome good thing</hi> TO GOD?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Theſe</hi> are the moſt <hi>noted Fathers</hi> of the <hi>Fourth Century;</hi> and for the <hi>Fifth,</hi> did S. <hi>Epiphanius</hi> teach <hi>Invocation</hi> of <hi>Saints,</hi> who proves the <hi>Divinity</hi> of <hi>Chriſt</hi> (as S. <hi>Athana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſius</hi> had done) from his being <hi>worſhipped;</hi> the moſt ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn expreſſion of <hi>Worſhip</hi> being <hi>Invocation</hi> or <hi>Prayer?</hi> did S. <hi>Ambroſe</hi> after he rightly underſtood the <hi>Chriſtian
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:94813:38"/>Religion</hi> teach any ſuch <hi>Invocation,</hi> who ſaid, <hi>that</hi> GOD ALONE <hi>was to be</hi> INVOCATED? Did S. <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi> teach it, who does ſo often exhort to <hi>our going to God our ſelves,</hi> aſſuring us <hi>we ſhall be ſooner heard when we ask our ſelves, than when we ask by another;</hi> who does with the reſt of the <hi>Fathers</hi> make the <hi>Eſſence</hi> of <hi>Prayer</hi> to be a <hi>Diſcourſing with God?</hi> Did S. <hi>Auſtin</hi> laſtly, whom the <hi>Jeſuit</hi> names, teach <hi>Invocation</hi> or <hi>Prayer</hi> to <hi>Saints,</hi> who ſays expreſly, that <hi>we ought to Pray to, or ask of</hi> GOD ALONE <hi>thoſe things we hope for?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I am ſo much accuſtomed to the <hi>Writers</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> that I do not ſo much wonder as I otherwiſe ſhould at the <hi>Jeſuits</hi> aſſerting a thing <hi>ſo very falſe</hi> with <hi>ſo much aſſurance:</hi> it is too frequent among them to chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge ALL the <hi>Fathers,</hi> when perhaps not <hi>one</hi> in <hi>twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi> is on their ſide, and therefore for the <hi>Jeſuit</hi> to aſſert, That <hi>all the Fathers</hi> of <hi>thoſe two Centuries</hi> are for <hi>Invoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Saints,</hi> is meerly a being in the <hi>faſhion.</hi> But can he think to impoſe upon us with ſuch things? does he think that <hi>Confidence</hi> is enough, or all that is neceſſary for the carrying of any cauſe? if he does, he ſhall find himſelf miſtaken, ſince there is too much learning in <hi>England</hi> to let ſuch bold and falſe aſſertions to paſs up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and delude the <hi>people</hi> without controul, or putting a ſtop to <hi>them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I need not aggravate, or further inſiſt on the falſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of all that the <hi>Jeſuit</hi> ſaid there; I had rather em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy my ſelf to vindicate the <hi>Fathers</hi> than to expoſe <hi>him:</hi> and therefore in order to the doing that by an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwering <hi>all</hi> the <hi>paſſages</hi> quoted out of <hi>them</hi> by the <hi>Jeſuit</hi> to defend <hi>Invocation</hi> of <hi>Saints,</hi> I will only requeſt, that <hi>theſe two</hi> very reaſonable <hi>Poſtulatum</hi>'s may be granted me.</p>
               <p>Firſt, That the <hi>Fathers</hi> of the <hi>Fourth</hi> and <hi>Fifth Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turies</hi> [about whom the <hi>Controverſie</hi> is betwixt <hi>me</hi> and
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:94813:38"/>the <hi>Jeſuit</hi>] did <hi>know</hi> the <hi>Practices,</hi> and <hi>underſtand</hi> the <hi>Doctrines</hi> of the <hi>Fathers</hi> of the <hi>Three preceding Ages</hi> of the <hi>Church.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, That the <hi>Fathers</hi> of the <hi>Fourth</hi> and <hi>Fifth Centuries,</hi> had ſo <hi>much learning</hi> as to <hi>underſtand,</hi> and ſo <hi>much ſenſe</hi> as not to <hi>contradict</hi> themſelves.</p>
               <p>Both theſe <hi>Conceſſions</hi> are ſo very juſt, that I hope there will be no diſpute about <hi>them;</hi> I will then with the help of them begin the <hi>Examination</hi> of all that the <hi>Jeſuit</hi> hath offered out of the <hi>Primitive Fathers</hi> in defence of <hi>Invocation</hi> of <hi>Saints.</hi> And to let the <hi>Jeſuit</hi> ſee I am not afraid of their <hi>beſt Arguments,</hi> I will anſwer that <hi>one</hi> which is omitted, I wonder how by <hi>himſelf,</hi> but was not only urged in the <hi>Nubes Teſtium,</hi> but is twice repeated by the <hi>Compiler</hi> in his <hi>Vindication</hi> of the <hi>Nubes Teſtium.</hi> It is the <hi>paſſage</hi> from S. <hi>Ambroſe</hi>'s <hi>Book de Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duis,</hi> wherein he ſays, <hi>Obſecrandi ſunt Angeli pro nobis. Martyres obſecrandi, the Angels are to be pray'd to, who are ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed for our defence; the Martyrs are to be pray'd to, whoſe Patronage we juſtly claim.</hi> This paſſage doth make the <hi>greateſt ſhew</hi> of any for the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> however in anſwer to <hi>this</hi> we tell them, that what S. <hi>Ambroſe</hi> wrote in <hi>that Book,</hi> was not the <hi>Doctrine</hi> of the <hi>Chriſtian Church,</hi> which S. <hi>Ambroſe</hi> did not underſtand <hi>when</hi> he wrote <hi>that Book,</hi> being then but a <hi>Novice,</hi> as not only <hi>this paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage</hi> about <hi>Angels,</hi> but <hi>ſome others</hi> in it do very evidently ſhew, and therefore <hi>this paſſage</hi> ought not to be inſiſted on as the <hi>Doctrine</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> then, ſince <hi>He</hi> doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs did not at that time underſtand the <hi>Church's Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines,</hi> nor ought <hi>it</hi> to be inſiſted on as S. <hi>Ambroſe's Opinion</hi> at leaſt, ſince it is evident, that <hi>he</hi> did after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards change his mind, when he underſtood <hi>Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity</hi> better, and did then declare his ſenſe to be, that GOD ALONE <hi>was to be</hi> INVOCATED <hi>or</hi> PRAY'D TO.</p>
               <p>This Anſwer is fair, and cannot be reaſonably gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſay'd,
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:94813:39"/>however ſince the <hi>Jeſuit</hi> and the <hi>Compiler</hi> will be angry at my ſaying S. <hi>Ambroſe</hi> was a <hi>Novice,</hi> and did not underſtand the <hi>Doctrines</hi> of the <hi>Chriſtian Church,</hi> when <hi>he</hi> wrote <hi>that Book;</hi> I will, to prevent their Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils, offer ſome further reaſons in defence of <hi>that Anſwer</hi> I have juſt made.

               </p>
               <p>This is ſufficient to ſhew, that <hi>Praying to Angels</hi> was far enough from being either a <hi>Practice</hi> or a <hi>Doctrine</hi> of the <hi>Primitive Church,</hi> ſince <hi>it</hi> was <hi>accurſed</hi> and branded with the <hi>title</hi> of <hi>Idolatry;</hi> and to ſhew further, that <hi>it</hi>

               </p>
               <p>Had the <hi>Compiler</hi> of the <hi>Nubes Teſtium</hi> known the <hi>true State</hi> and <hi>Doctrines</hi> of the <hi>Primitive Church</hi> during the firſt <hi>four Ages,</hi> He would never have been guilty of bringing in S. <hi>Ambroſe</hi> for a <hi>Teacher</hi> of <hi>Invocation</hi> and <hi>Praying</hi> to <hi>Angels,</hi> which the <hi>Church</hi> had not only <hi>always oppoſed,</hi> but had juſt before S. <hi>Ambroſe</hi>'s <hi>own time accur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed as ſecret Idolatry,</hi> and a <hi>forſaking of Chriſt:</hi> but ſuch paſſages as <hi>this,</hi> and <hi>downright Hereſy</hi> ſometimes are <hi>quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,</hi> if they do but promiſe any the leaſt ſervice to the <hi>defence</hi> of the <hi>preſent Doctrines</hi> and <hi>Practices</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome:</hi> Unhappy Church! that art forc'd to make uſe of <hi>ſuch,</hi> or to have <hi>none.</hi>

               <p>It is time for me now to attend the <hi>Jeſuit,</hi> and ſee what <hi>he</hi> produces to ſhew, that <hi>Invocation</hi> or <hi>Prayer</hi> to <hi>Saints,</hi> was <hi>taught</hi> in the <hi>Fourth</hi> and <hi>Fifth Ages.</hi>

                  <hi>He</hi> begins with S. <hi>Auſtin,</hi> but ſo little is the <hi>Jeſuit</hi>'s Skill, and ſo ill his Fortune, that <hi>he</hi> firſt quotes a <hi>paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage</hi> that breaks the neck of his whole deſign. For in <hi>that anſwer</hi> to <hi>Fauſtus</hi> the <hi>Manichee,</hi> who had objected to the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> the <hi>Worſhipping of their Martyrs, he</hi> owns indeed (as the <hi>Jeſuit</hi> quotes <hi>him</hi>) that <hi>they</hi> did <hi>worſhip</hi> the <hi>Martyrs,</hi> but <hi>he</hi> tells him alſo, that it was only with the <hi>Worſhip of Love and Fellowſhip, which is paid alſo to the Holy Men of God while on earth.</hi> I ask the <hi>Jeſuit</hi> therefore what <hi>Church</hi> ever did, and whether even <hi>their Church</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> doth order <hi>Invocation</hi> or <hi>Prayers</hi> to be put up to their <hi>Fellow Chriſtians,</hi> tho' the <hi>moſt holy</hi> on Earth?

               <p>And as for thoſe <hi>Practices</hi> of <hi>Addreſſes</hi> to the <hi>Martyrs</hi> at <hi>their Memories</hi> cited from S. <hi>Baſil,</hi> S. <hi>Gregory Nyſſen,</hi> St. <hi>Chryſoſtom,</hi> and <hi>Theodoret,</hi> and ſo much inſiſted on by the <hi>Jeſuit</hi> as being the <hi>ſame thing,</hi> and <hi>all</hi> that is practiſed by the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> towards the <hi>Saints</hi> and <hi>Angels;</hi> we can very eaſily prove a <hi>vaſt difference</hi> betwixt what was done <hi>then,</hi> and what is practiſed <hi>now</hi> by the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> and ſince the <hi>Jeſuit</hi> doth challenge <hi>me</hi> ſo often to ſhew the <hi>difference,</hi> I will an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer his <hi>Challenge,</hi> and do aſſign only <hi>three Differences</hi> out of <hi>more</hi> that I could offer.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Firſt Difference</hi> is that the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> doth uſe a <hi>direct Invocation,</hi> or <hi>formal Prayer</hi> to the <hi>Saints</hi> and <hi>Angels,</hi> as is apparent from <hi>hundreds</hi> of places in their <hi>Miſſalls, Breviaries</hi> and <hi>Offices,</hi> whereas the <hi>Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive Fathers</hi> of the <hi>end</hi> of the <hi>Fourth</hi> and <hi>Fifth Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tury</hi> did not <hi>invocate</hi> or <hi>make Prayers</hi> to the <hi>Saints,</hi> but meerly <hi>ſuch Addreſſes</hi> or <hi>Requeſts</hi> as are made from <hi>one
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:94813:44"/>Friend</hi> to <hi>another:</hi> and this I do prove out of their <hi>own mouths,</hi> who make PRAYER to be PECULIAR to GOD ALONE, and therefore would not contradict <hi>their own Doctrine</hi> by <hi>their own Practice,</hi> which theſe <hi>Fathers</hi> had inevitably done, had they reſerved <hi>Prayer</hi> as proper to GOD ALONE, and yet offered <hi>Prayer</hi> or <hi>Invocation</hi> to the <hi>Saints.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A ſecond <hi>Difference</hi> is that, whereas thoſe <hi>Requeſts</hi> were made at the <hi>Memories</hi> of <hi>thoſe Martyrs</hi> to <hi>whom</hi> they were preſented, and <hi>who</hi> were believed to be <hi>preſent there</hi> tho' <hi>inviſibly</hi> at <hi>that time;</hi> the <hi>Invocations</hi> and <hi>Prayers</hi> to the <hi>Saints</hi> in the <hi>preſent Church</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> are made not only in <hi>every place,</hi> but in <hi>ten thouſand diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent</hi> and <hi>moſt diſtant places</hi> to ſuch or ſuch a particular <hi>Saint;</hi> which is virtually to aſcribe to <hi>them</hi> an <hi>Omnipre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, an</hi> Attribute that <hi>no finite Being</hi> is capable of.</p>
               <p>The third <hi>Difference</hi> is that <hi>thoſe Requeſts</hi> and <hi>Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pellations</hi> to the <hi>Martyrs</hi> were <hi>neither commanded</hi> by the <hi>Primitive Church, Authorized</hi> by her <hi>General</hi> or <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincial,</hi> or any other <hi>Councils,</hi> nor uſed in the <hi>Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Offices</hi> of the <hi>Church;</hi> whereas; on the contrary, the <hi>Invocations</hi> and <hi>Prayers to Saints</hi> in the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> are <hi>enjoyned</hi> by the <hi>Roman Church,</hi> are <hi>authorized</hi> by her <hi>laſt General Council</hi> of <hi>Trent,</hi> and uſed not only in the <hi>Publick Offices</hi> of their <hi>Church,</hi> but in the <hi>moſt ſolemn Parts</hi> of their <hi>Offices,</hi> in the <hi>Litanies</hi> of the <hi>Church.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I could add more, but <hi>theſe</hi> are enough to ſhew the <hi>vaſt difference</hi> betwixt what is <hi>now</hi> practiſed in the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> towards the <hi>Saints,</hi> and what was done to them at the <hi>latter end</hi> of the <hi>Fourth,</hi> and in the <hi>Fifth Age</hi> of the <hi>Church,</hi> which is the time of the <hi>Primitive Church</hi> in diſpute betwixt <hi>me,</hi> and the <hi>Compiler,</hi> and the <hi>Jeſuit.</hi>

               <pb n="79" facs="tcp:94813:44"/>
               <p>Thus I have been ſo civil as to accept the <hi>Jeſuit</hi>'s Chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge, and to make him a fair and diſtinct <hi>Reply,</hi> and have been more civil to <hi>him</hi> than I ought to have been, ſince according to the <hi>Law</hi> of <hi>Arms,</hi> I think the <hi>Chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge</hi> I made to the <hi>Jeſuit</hi> among the reſt of the <hi>Romiſh Prieſts</hi> in <hi>England</hi> (to ſhew me but <hi>one Canon</hi> of the <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Church</hi> for the firſt <hi>ſix hundred years</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> for the <hi>Pope</hi>'s <hi>Supremacy</hi>) ought to have been accepted and anſwered before <hi>any</hi> of <hi>them</hi> were allowed to make any <hi>Challenges</hi> to <hi>me.</hi> But ſince it was impoſſible for the <hi>Jeſuit</hi> or any of <hi>them</hi> to produce ſuch a <hi>Canon,</hi> and therefore to make <hi>any Reply</hi> to that Challenge; I will at parting tell the <hi>Jeſuit,</hi> that if he intends to proſecute this <hi>Controverſy</hi> about <hi>Invocation</hi> of <hi>Saints,</hi> it is my turn to challenge, and therefore I do challenge him to ſhew as <hi>fair</hi> and as <hi>uninterrupted</hi> a <hi>Practice</hi> and <hi>Doctrine for In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation</hi> of <hi>Saints,</hi> as I have produced <hi>againſt it for the Four Firſt Centuries of the Church,</hi> out of the <hi>Liturgies</hi> and <hi>Genuine Works</hi> of the <hi>Fathers</hi> of thoſe <hi>diſtinst Ages.</hi>

               <p>I muſt now return to the <hi>Compiler</hi>'s <hi>Vindication</hi> of the <hi>Nubes Teſtium,</hi> and ſhould paſs to the <hi>next Chapter</hi> about <hi>Reliques,</hi> but that I muſt not forget to take notice of a very terrible <hi>Objection</hi> againſt <hi>us</hi> in relation to this <hi>Invo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,</hi> which I had like to have omitted. The <hi>Reader</hi> I ſuppoſe does remember, that the <hi>Compiler</hi> had ſaid, that <hi>I had granted that Invocation of Saints was practiſed in the Fourth</hi> and <hi>Fifth Ages of the Church,</hi> upon <hi>this</hi> he very learnedly obſerves againſt me, <hi>that even one of the Four Firſt General Councils was held within the ſame time, without ever cenſuring it as an Error, tho' even before that, this Practice is own'd to have taken root in many Places.</hi> This paſſage is very diverting, and ſhews with what an air of confidence <hi>ſome men</hi> can write the moſt <hi>abſurd things,</hi> and tack together the moſt inconſiſtent: I had thought
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:94813:45"/>I had taught the <hi>Compiler</hi> a little more care and circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpection when <hi>he</hi> meddles with <hi>Chronology</hi>-matters in my <hi>Anſwer</hi> to his <hi>Nubes Teſtium,</hi> but I perceive nothing will do good upon <hi>him,</hi> nor learn him more caution. Well then, ſince <hi>he</hi> is ſo wilful, and cannot be perſua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded from making ſuch <hi>lamentable blunders</hi> in <hi>Chronology,</hi> he muſt e'en thank himſelf if <hi>he</hi> be expoſed for it, and laſht for <hi>it</hi> as he does deſerve.</p>
               <p>He firſt then obſerves, that <hi>even one of the Four Firſt General Councils was held within the ſame time,</hi> that is, within the <hi>Fourth</hi> and <hi>Fifth Centuries.</hi> By this <hi>One of the Four Firſt General Councils,</hi> I ſuppoſe, he means the <hi>Council</hi> of <hi>Nice;</hi> and I muſt needs tell <hi>him,</hi> that he gueſſed very well to ſay, that <hi>that Council</hi> was held with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the <hi>time</hi> of thoſe <hi>two Centuries,</hi> but that <hi>he</hi> had gueſs'd a great deal better if <hi>he</hi> had ſaid, that <hi>even all the Four Firſt General Councils</hi> were held within <hi>that time;</hi> for there is no body that pretends to <hi>any</hi> the leaſt skill in <hi>Chronology,</hi> that would not have readily told <hi>him</hi> that they were <hi>all four</hi> held and over within <hi>two Years</hi> after the <hi>middle</hi> of the <hi>Fifth Century.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>His next <hi>Obſervation</hi> is like <hi>this,</hi> he tells us, <hi>That this General Council did not cenſure Invocation of Saints as an Error;</hi> if he means the <hi>Council</hi> of <hi>Nice,</hi> as I before ſuppoſed he did, it is a very great Truth that <hi>that Council</hi> did not cenſure <hi>Invocation</hi> of <hi>Saints as an Error,</hi> and there was a very good Reaſon for <hi>it,</hi> and that was, becauſe there was no <hi>ſuch thing</hi> as <hi>Invocation</hi> of <hi>Saints</hi> practiſed in the <hi>Church</hi> when that <hi>Council</hi> was held, nor of above <hi>two hundred Years</hi> after; but ſome men love to make <hi>wiſe Obſervations,</hi> tho' they miſs their aim too too often. Well! But what will the <hi>Compiler</hi> ſay, if I ſhew <hi>him</hi> that tho' not the <hi>Firſt,</hi> yet <hi>One</hi> of <hi>theſe Four General Councils</hi> did <hi>cenſure Invocation of Angels,</hi> (and conſequently of <hi>Saints</hi>) <hi>as an Error,</hi> and
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:94813:45"/>as a moſt groſs one too? This I will do, that ſo <hi>he</hi> may curſe his ill Fate for putting him upon making ſuch an <hi>untoward Objection</hi> againſt us, and learn for the future, if <hi>he</hi> is not deaf to Advice, to look before he leaps into ſuch <hi>recoyling Objections.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>For the proof of the <hi>Firſt,</hi> I need only inſiſt on what the <hi>Council</hi> of <hi>Trent</hi> in her <hi>twenty-fifth</hi> and <hi>laſt Seſſion</hi> did <hi>decree</hi> about <hi>Reliques,</hi> that <hi>the Bodies and Reliques</hi> of <hi>the Saints were to be worſhipped,</hi> and a little after <hi>ſhe</hi> denoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces an <hi>Anathema againſt all that ſhould affirm, that Venera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Honour are not to be paid to Reliques.</hi> That by <hi>Veneration</hi> and <hi>Honour</hi> in <hi>this Decree Religious Worſhip</hi> is meant, may be cleared from the <hi>beſt Writers</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> who uſe the words <hi>Veneration</hi> and <hi>Ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration</hi> promiſcuouſly, and in the <hi>ſame ſenſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus <hi>Vaſques</hi> the <hi>great Schoolman,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Vaſques in Par. 3. D. Thom.

               <p>This I queſtion not will be able to convince <hi>all Men</hi> that VENERATION and ADORATION are promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcuouſly uſed for the <hi>ſame thing,</hi> and that by appointing a VENERATION <hi>to be paid to the</hi> RELIQUES <hi>of the Saints,</hi> the <hi>Council</hi> of <hi>Trent</hi> did command that THE RELIQUES of <hi>Saints ſhould be</hi> ADORED: and this is ſufficient for what I undertook to prove, <hi>That the Church of</hi> Rome <hi>doth command the Worſhip of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liques.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That <hi>ſhe</hi> doth <hi>practiſe</hi> the <hi>Worſhipping</hi> of <hi>Reliques</hi> is what I have next to ſhew; but <hi>this</hi> may be diſpatch'd in a <hi>few Words,</hi> ſince every body knows that <hi>their Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple</hi> in the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> are not behind hand in <hi>practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing</hi>

               </p>
               <p>I muſt then prove my Second Particular, <hi>That for the Firſt five Centuries of the Church, the Worſhip of Reliques was neither commanded nor practiſed by the Primitive Church.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To prove that the <hi>Worſhip</hi> of <hi>Reliques was not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded</hi> during <hi>that time,</hi> we need only to appeal to the <hi>Canons</hi> and <hi>Laws</hi> of the <hi>Four General Councils</hi> held with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the <hi>Fourth</hi> and <hi>Fifth Century,</hi> wherein <hi>not a Syllable</hi> is to be met with about <hi>any ſuch thing:</hi> and <hi>they</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> are as well ſatisfied as <hi>we,</hi> that there is nothing in <hi>thoſe Councils</hi> for their purpoſe about <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liques,</hi> and therefore do not pretend to ſhew <hi>any Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand</hi> for the <hi>Worſhip</hi> of <hi>Images</hi> from <hi>any</hi> of <hi>thoſe Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils.</hi>

               <p>And that the <hi>Primitive Church</hi> did not <hi>practiſe any Worſhip</hi> of <hi>Reliques</hi> during <hi>that time,</hi> is as eaſie to ſhew from the <hi>Generality</hi> of the <hi>Fathers,</hi> who were utterly againſt <hi>Worſhipping</hi> the <hi>Saints themſelves,</hi> and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently much more againſt the <hi>Worſhipping any</hi> of the <hi>Mortal Remains</hi> of thoſe <hi>Saints.</hi> I will only inſiſt upon <hi>two,</hi> who lived in the <hi>beginning</hi> of the <hi>Fifth Century</hi> of the <hi>Church,</hi> S. <hi>Auſtin</hi> to prove that <hi>they</hi> did not then <hi>worſhip the Saints themſelves,</hi> and S. <hi>Hierom</hi> to ſhew that <hi>they did</hi> not worſhip the <hi>Saints Reliques.</hi>

               <p>There is one Great Miſtake that the <hi>Compiler</hi> muſt be rectified in, before I leave <hi>this Chapter</hi> about <hi>Reliques,</hi> and that is from the <hi>Community</hi> of Actions and Expreſſions to gather that the <hi>ſame thing</hi> was done by <hi>ſome</hi> of the

                  <hi>Fathers</hi> towards the <hi>Reliques,</hi> that is done <hi>now</hi> in the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome: He</hi> cannot be ignorant that moſt of the <hi>External Expreſſions</hi> of <hi>Reſpect</hi> are common to <hi>Civil</hi> and <hi>Religious Worſhip,</hi> and yet that <hi>no Body</hi> is ſo wild as to conclude from thence that <hi>Civil</hi> and <hi>Religious Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip</hi> are the <hi>ſame thing.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>When <hi>Abraham</hi> bowed himſelf to the ground before the <hi>Children</hi> of <hi>Heth,</hi> he uſed the <hi>very ſame Geſture</hi> that he was wont to make uſe of in <hi>his Worſhip</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> and yet I hope our <hi>Compiler</hi> would not have it concluded from the <hi>ſame Geſture</hi> uſed upon <hi>both thoſe</hi> Occaſions, either that <hi>Abraham,</hi> when he bowed to the <hi>Children</hi> of <hi>Heth,</hi> paid <hi>Religious Worſhip</hi> unto <hi>them,</hi> or that <hi>he,</hi> uſing the <hi>ſame Geſture</hi> in the <hi>Service</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> paid only a <hi>Civil Worſhip</hi> unto <hi>Him.</hi> And yet <hi>This</hi> is all that he builds upon, when <hi>he</hi> is ſo earneſt about the <hi>thing,</hi> and would confound <hi>Civil</hi> and <hi>Religious Worſhip,</hi> by ſhewing what no Body denies, that <hi>ſeveral</hi> of the <hi>Outward Expreſſions</hi> of <hi>Civil</hi> and <hi>Religious Worſhip</hi> are the <hi>ſame.</hi> Whereas, notwithſtanding the <hi>Outward Geſtures</hi> be the <hi>ſame,</hi> we do eaſily know <hi>Religious</hi> from <hi>Civil Worſhip,</hi> by the <hi>Object</hi> to whom it is paid, and by the <hi>Profeſſions</hi> of them <hi>who</hi> pay <hi>it.</hi>

               <p>I have inſiſted the longer upon <hi>this Buſineſs</hi> about the <hi>Reliques,</hi> becauſe the <hi>Compiler</hi> himſelf did; and have ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken the more care to clear the whole Matter about the <hi>Worſhip</hi> of <hi>Reliques,</hi> becauſe <hi>He</hi> took ſo much pains to diſguiſe and obſcure <hi>it,</hi> and by confounding <hi>Civil</hi> and <hi>Religious Worſhip,</hi> to bear the <hi>credulous Reader</hi> in hand that the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> and the <hi>Primitive Church</hi> are exactly the <hi>ſame</hi> in <hi>their Reſpect</hi> to <hi>Reliques:</hi> and that the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> doth no more pay a <hi>Religious Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip</hi> or <hi>Adoration</hi> to <hi>Reliques,</hi> than the <hi>Primitive Fathers</hi> did: the Vanity and Falſhood of <hi>all which</hi> I have fully diſplay'd, that ſo the <hi>Compiler</hi> being driven out of <hi>this Hold,</hi> and being made aſhamed of ſuch <hi>groundleſs Delu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions</hi> and <hi>Diſtinctions,</hi> may e'en fall into the <hi>Old Track</hi> of defending <hi>Popery,</hi> and ſpeak out fairly the <hi>Senſe</hi> of <hi>their Church</hi> about the <hi>Worſhip</hi> of <hi>Reliques,</hi> and defend with the <hi>Angelical Doctor</hi> S. <hi>Thomas Aquinas,</hi> and his <hi>Diſciples,</hi> (who, <hi>Sabran</hi> the <hi>Jeſuit</hi> tells us, are <hi>above One half of the Divines of the Christian World</hi>)
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:94813:51"/>that THE RELIQUES <hi>of the</hi> SAINTS OUGHT TO BE ADORED.</p>
               <p>He next undertakes the buſineſs of <hi>Purgatory,</hi> and finding that I had invincibly ſhewn, that the <hi>Primitive Fathers,</hi> notwithſtanding their <hi>Prayers</hi> for the Faithful deceaſed, did believe, that they were at the <hi>ſame time</hi> in a <hi>ſtate</hi> of <hi>Bliſs,</hi> of <hi>Comfort,</hi> of <hi>Peace,</hi> of <hi>Joy,</hi> and <hi>Light</hi> and <hi>Tranquillity,</hi> nay in <hi>Heaven it ſelf;</hi> every one of which is utterly inconſiſtent with the <hi>Condition</hi> of <hi>Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatory</hi> believed and taught by the <hi>Church of Rome;</hi> He hopes to ſalve all, by granting what <hi>he</hi> could not deny of the <hi>Primitive Fathers</hi> believing the <hi>Faithful</hi> deceaſed to be in ſuch a Condition, and reconciling <hi>all this</hi> to the <hi>Belief</hi> of <hi>Purgatory</hi> in his <hi>Church.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To this purpoſe he tells us, <hi>that the ſuppoſing thoſe Souls, for which the Fathers pray'd, to be in a State of Joy and Comfort, does moſt nearly agree with the preſent Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice and Doctrine of the Church of Rome.</hi> I am glad to hear this, and now I perceive there is none of thoſe tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and burnings in the Caſe, with which the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple uſed to be frighted out of their Wits themſelves, and to ſcare one another: but the unhappineſs is, this is too good news to be true; and I doubt we ſhall find by and by that the <hi>Romiſh Purgatory</hi> is the very ſame place that it uſed to be thought, and that it is juſt as hot, and as tormenting and intolerable at this very day as it was ſix hundred years ago, when thoſe lamenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſhreeks were ſo often heard from the <hi>poor Souls</hi> in <hi>Purgatory:</hi> However ſince I ſuppoſe our <hi>Compiler</hi> knows himſelf not to have been ſo careful of his Life as to ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine he ſhall eſcape calling at <hi>Purgatory,</hi> I cannot diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend his making <hi>Purgatory</hi> as eaſy as he can, and his repreſenting it to be juſt ſuch a place as he would with all his heart find it, when he comes thither.</p>
               <p>He endeavours to prove <hi>this agreement</hi> from <hi>that
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:94813:52"/>Prayer</hi> in the <hi>Canon</hi> of the <hi>Maſs</hi> uſed in <hi>their Church,</hi> wherein they pray <hi>God</hi> to <hi>grant to thoſe his faithful Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants who reſt in the ſleep of Peace, a Place of Comfort, Light and Peace.</hi> In anſwer to which I will only tell <hi>him</hi> here, that this <hi>Old-Prayer</hi> in the <hi>Canon</hi> of the <hi>Maſs</hi> is directly againſt the <hi>preſent Church</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> in the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs of <hi>Purgatory,</hi> and againſt what the <hi>Compiler</hi> hath poſitively aſſerted a little after this about <hi>Prayer</hi> not being made for thoſe in <hi>Bliſs,</hi> or thoſe in <hi>Hell,</hi> but only for <hi>thoſe</hi> who could be relieved by the <hi>Prayers</hi> of the <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving;</hi> as I ſhall by and by ſhew. In the mean time I will conſider what he further offers to prove this A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement; and this is no other than to tell us over a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, that the <hi>State</hi> of <hi>Purgatory</hi> is agreeable to <hi>that Prayer,</hi> and then to deſcribe it, by telling us very grave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, <hi>that in Purgatory there is a kind of Reſt and Quiet, where the Interior Powers of the Souls are well order'd and compos'd; the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding ſetled in the Light of Faith, the Will inflam'd with the Love of God, the Imagination undiſturb'd, and ſecure Hopes of once enjoying God, filling the Souls with a happy Reſignation and Comfort.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And is not this very Comical ſtuff? Certainly, all that read it will wonder whence this Man comes to have ſo very nice and exact an account of the <hi>State</hi> of <hi>Purgatory,</hi> as to know how every one of the Faculties of our Soul are employ'd there. One would think he had been there already himſelf, or that ſomebody hath ſlipt out thence, and inſtead of going ſtreight to Heaven had come to Earth again, to inform the <hi>Compiler</hi> how things ſtand there, and how every one is employ'd there; which brings into my mind that <hi>Dialogue</hi> of <hi>Lucian,</hi> which gives us juſt ſuch another account of the <hi>State of the Dead:</hi> I muſt confeſs I cannot read ſuch things without an Indignation to ſee grave men Romancing about things ſo ſerious; and tho' I can bear well enough
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:94813:52"/>Sir <hi>Thomas Moor</hi>'s <hi>Accounts</hi> what people do, and how they are taken up in his <hi>

                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>topia,</hi> and to ridicule the <hi>Chriſtian Religion</hi> to the World.</p>
               <p>I cannot find that the <hi>Compiler</hi> makes the <hi>nature</hi> of their <hi>Purgatory</hi> to be any thing elſe than the <hi>Longing de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire of thoſe in it of ſeeing and enjoying God,</hi> which <hi>long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing deſire</hi> doth give them a <hi>moſt afflicting Anguiſh; from which they are capable of being delivered and reliev'd by the Prayers of their Friends on Earth.</hi> And he concludes, that <hi>this is all that is required in our Profeſſion of Faith, in which 'tis ſaid, I hold that there is a Purgatory, and that the Souls there detain'd, are reliev'd by the Suffrages of the Faithful.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I know the <hi>Compiler</hi> too well to truſt him in theſe things, wherein he hath taken a great deal of pains to no purpoſe in the World, ſince it is very eaſy to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrate, that <hi>He</hi> and F. <hi>Alexandre,</hi> with the <hi>other Expoſitors</hi> of the <hi>New Popery</hi> have quite run away from the true <hi>old doctrine</hi> of their <hi>Church</hi> about <hi>Purgatory;</hi> that the <hi>true Purgatory</hi> of the <hi>Church of Rome</hi> is as incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent with <hi>that State</hi> of <hi>Light, Tranquillity</hi> and <hi>Comfort,</hi> wherein the <hi>Primitive Fathers</hi> ſuppoſed the <hi>Faithful</hi> to be, as <hi>Light</hi> is with <hi>Darkneſs,</hi> Torment with Eaſe, and the moſt exquiſite Pain with Pleaſure.</p>
               <p>And this is what I will now prove, that the <hi>Romiſh Purgatory</hi> is a <hi>place</hi> of <hi>Corment,</hi> wherein the <hi>Souls</hi> of thoſe who are in it, undergo the <hi>ſame pains</hi> that the <hi>damned</hi> do, and that there is no other difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:94813:53"/>
                  <hi>Hell-Fire</hi> and <hi>Purgatory-Fire,</hi> but that the one is Eternal, and the other but Temporal: and this I am ſure will diſcover the abſurdity of all that our <hi>Compiler</hi> hath ſaid here in his <hi>Vindication,</hi> and ruin the pretended agreement betwixt the <hi>Primitive Fathers State of Joy and Tranquillity,</hi> and the <hi>Purgatory</hi> of the <hi>Church of Rome.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Council</hi> of <hi>Trent</hi> was ſo ſhy, or rather ſo cunning, about the buſineſs of <hi>Purgatory,</hi> that ſhe only decrees in general terms, <hi>That there is a Purgatory, and that the Souls detain'd there do receive Relief by the Prayers of the Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, but eſpecially</hi>

                  <hi>by the acceptable Sacrifice of the Maſs;</hi> without telling us one word further of the State, Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, Condition or Place of this Purgatory, or any other Circumſtances that might explain the Nature of it to them, who, notwithſtanding theſe general ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guous words, are bound to believe it as much as the <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle</hi> of the <hi>Trinity:</hi> So that either there is no way of knowing what this <hi>Purgatory</hi> is, or we muſt gather the knowledge of the nature and condition of it from the beſt <hi>approved Writers</hi> or <hi>general ſenſe</hi> of <hi>their Church</hi> about <hi>it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I could not but ſmile, I muſt confeſs, to find the <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piler</hi> to be ſo very ſhy in <hi>his Vindication,</hi> and to be ſo afraid of having any body believe that there is any thing of <hi>Fire</hi> in the Caſe when he is deſcribing the nature of <hi>Purgatory,</hi> ſince tho' he had forgotten it, yet I had not, how in his <hi>Nubes Teſtium</hi> he makes the <hi>greateſt ſhow</hi> for <hi>Purgatory</hi> with his PURGING FIRE out of <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gory Nyſſen,</hi> with his PURGATORY FIRE out of S. <hi>Baſil,</hi> and with his <hi>Baptiſm of</hi> FIRE <hi>after Death,</hi> out of <hi>Gregory Nazianzen;</hi> but now in <hi>his Vindication, He</hi> hath put all the <hi>Three Fires</hi> out, and all this becauſe tho' they did agree well enough with <hi>Places</hi> of <hi>Light,</hi> yet there were no ways poſſible of making 'em <hi>Places</hi> of <hi>Comfort</hi>
                  <pb n="97" facs="tcp:94813:53"/>and <hi>Joy;</hi> and therefore they deſerv'd to be put quite out.</p>
               <p>Of all the <hi>Writers</hi> I ever met with, I never obſerved any that would plunge himſelf ſo grievouſly as this poor <hi>Compiler</hi> will; tho' he ſet himſelf never ſo warmly to prove any thing, nay to be as earneſt for it as if the whole of Chriſtianity did depend upon it; yet if after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards he finds that the matter is or may be turn'd upon him, then farewel this or that Opinion, and all the quotations for it into the bargain; he wipes his Mouth, gets into another Box, and then talks or writes as if he had never affirmed, nay not heard of any ſuch thing.</p>
               <p>Well then, ſince the <hi>Compiler</hi> is for throwing away <hi>all his quotations</hi> out of the <hi>Fathers</hi> to prove <hi>Purgatory</hi> was a FIRE, I cannot make uſe of them, ſince he has put them all out: but muſt inquire among other people to ſee what <hi>they</hi> make the <hi>Nature</hi> of <hi>Purgatory</hi> to be. There is none ſo able or ſo probable to help me herein as <hi>Bellarmine;</hi> One of the greateſt Men their <hi>Church</hi> ever had. The <hi>Cardinal</hi> in his <hi>ſecond Book</hi> about <hi>Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatory,</hi> examining the <hi>Nature</hi> of <hi>Purgatory,</hi> concludes thus, <hi>It is certain, that in Purgatory as well as in Hell, there is a Puniſhment</hi>

               <p>Here we find <hi>Bellarmine</hi> determining that <hi>Purgatory-Fire,</hi> and <hi>Hell-Fire,</hi> are the <hi>very ſame</hi> by <hi>Nature:</hi> and the <hi>Title</hi> of his <hi>next Chapter</hi> is <hi>Ignem Purgatorii eſſe Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poreum,

                  <hi>He</hi> urges, that it is <hi>Communis ſententia Theologorum, the Common Opinion of their Divines, that Purgatory-Fire is True and Real Fire, and of the ſame kind with our Elementary Fire.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I have choſen thus to give <hi>Bellarmine</hi>'s <hi>words</hi> in this <hi>Controverſy,</hi> becauſe he does not urge his <hi>own ſenſe</hi> or Thoughts only about the <hi>Nature</hi> of <hi>Purgatory,</hi> but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts upon it, and tells us, that <hi>it is the</hi> COMMON JUDGMENT <hi>of their</hi> DIVINES, that <hi>Purgatory-Fire is true real Elementary Fire:</hi> as before he had deliver'd as a thing CERTAIN, <hi>that Purgatory-Fire</hi> and <hi>Hell-Fire</hi> are the <hi>ſame</hi> in <hi>kind.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But I need not content my ſelf with <hi>Bellarmine</hi> and the <hi>Common Conſent</hi> of the <hi>Divines</hi> of the <hi>Church of Rome</hi> to prove that the <hi>Romiſh Purgatory</hi> is a <hi>Place</hi> of <hi>Torments</hi> by <hi>Fire:</hi> I have better evidence for <hi>it,</hi> and ſuch as our <hi>Compiler,</hi> nor <hi>any</hi> of the <hi>New Expoſitors</hi> of <hi>Popery</hi> dare not refuſe, if they will allow <hi>One</hi> of <hi>their General Councils</hi> to be of as <hi>much Authority</hi> among them as <hi>another.</hi> In the <hi>Account we</hi> have of the <hi>General Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil of Florence,</hi> we find the <hi>Latins</hi> continually contend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for a <hi>Purgatory-Fire.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus in the <hi>Hiſtory</hi> of what did immediately precede the <hi>Firſt Seſſion</hi> of <hi>this Council</hi> at <hi>Ferrara</hi> (from <hi>whence,</hi> by reaſon of the <hi>Plague,</hi> it was removed to <hi>Florence</hi>) we find a <hi>ſelect number</hi> of <hi>twelve Latins</hi> and <hi>twelve Greeks,</hi> appointed to meet, and debate of the <hi>chief points</hi> in <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſy</hi> betwixt the <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Roman Church.</hi> The point about <hi>Purgatory</hi> was the firſt debated, where the <hi>Latins</hi> at firſt word told <hi>their Churches ſenſe,</hi> that by <hi>Purgatory they</hi> meant <hi>a Purging</hi> FIRE, and throughout the <hi>whole debate</hi> we find them ſtill uſing the term <hi>Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatory-Fire</hi> for to expreſs their <hi>Churches ſenſe</hi> about the <hi>Nature</hi> of <hi>Purgatory:</hi> the <hi>Greeks</hi> are perfectly againſt

               <p>This Account of the <hi>Sence</hi> of the <hi>Roman Church</hi> is ſo plain for a <hi>Purgatory Fire,</hi> which differs only from <hi>Hell Fire</hi> in that the <hi>one</hi> is <hi>Temporary</hi> and <hi>during this World,</hi> but the <hi>other Eternal</hi> in <hi>the World to come,</hi> that it would be very vain to offer at any thing for the further clearing of it here: I muſt only not forget to take notice of the <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence</hi> of the <hi>Compiler,</hi> who will very magiſterially have the <hi>Greeks</hi> and the <hi>Latins to differ</hi> chiefly herein <hi>about a Name;</hi> and is angry at me for ſaying the <hi>Greeks diſown any ſuch Place as Purgatory:</hi> whereas it is as plain as the Sun, that the <hi>Greeks</hi> do diſown <hi>Purgatory,</hi> as it ſignifies <hi>a Place of Torment, wherein Souls are purged by Fire,</hi> which <hi>he</hi> cannot but know was the <hi>Sence</hi> in which I uſed the <hi>word,</hi> and the <hi>whole Church of Rome too,</hi> except<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a <hi>few Expoſitors</hi> and <hi>Repreſenters,</hi> who ſince they cannot defend the <hi>Doctrines</hi> and <hi>Practices</hi> of their <hi>Church,</hi> are running away quite from <hi>them,</hi> and ſetting up a

               <p>If the Times were thought ſo bad, when that <hi>Cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſm</hi> was drawn up, what muſt be thought of <hi>ours,</hi> when not only the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> will not endure this SOUND DOCTRINE, but the <hi>Preſent Writers</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> the <hi>Biſhop</hi> of <hi>Meaux,</hi> his <hi>Vindicator,</hi> and the <hi>Compiler</hi> will no more endure this SOUND DOC<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TRINE <hi>of a</hi> PURGATORY FIRE than the <hi>Hereticks,</hi> but cry out ſo often that the <hi>Church doth not believe,</hi> that the <hi>Church doth not teach</hi> a <hi>Purgatory</hi> FIRE.

               <p>But I have a better evidence than <hi>all theſe</hi> to prove, that by <hi>Purgatory</hi> the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> doth certainly mean a <hi>Place</hi> of <hi>Torment,</hi> wherein <hi>thoſe Souls</hi> that are

This Prayer</hi> then muſt be put up for <hi>one</hi> of theſe <hi>three ſorts</hi> of <hi>men,</hi> either for the <hi>Souls</hi> who are in <hi>Heaven,</hi> or for the <hi>Souls</hi> who are in <hi>Hell,</hi> or for <hi>ſome Souls</hi> who are neither in <hi>Heaven,</hi> nor <hi>Hell,</hi> but in a <hi>middle State</hi> or <hi>Place</hi> which their <hi>Church</hi> doth call <hi>Purgatory.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Is <hi>this Prayer</hi> therefore uſed for the <hi>Souls</hi> in <hi>Heaven?</hi> No, ſays our <hi>Compiler, for it is needleſs to pray for thoſe that are in Heaven; there being no want there at all, no want of Relief, of Refreſhment</hi> [and conſequently no <hi>Hell-Torments</hi>
                  <pb n="104" facs="tcp:94813:57"/>undergone by <hi>any Souls</hi> there] <hi>of Pardon; there being no Guilt there of Sins.</hi> Is it for the <hi>Souls in Hell?</hi> No, replies the <hi>Compiler</hi> again, <hi>it is as fruitleſs to pray for thoſe in Hell, that State being wholly irreverſible:</hi> So that by his help <hi>we</hi> have light upon the <hi>Souls</hi> that are prayed for there, and thoſe are the <hi>Souls in Purgatory,</hi> which according to this <hi>Prayer,</hi> undergo their <hi>Hell-Torments,</hi> and are in a Condition nothing different from the <hi>damned</hi> but meerly in the <hi>Duration</hi> of <hi>their Pains, theſe Souls torments</hi> being but <hi>temporary,</hi> but <hi>thoſe</hi> of the damned <hi>eternal.</hi> And for the Condition of the <hi>Place</hi> in which theſe miſerable Souls are, we find it here repreſented in <hi>this Prayer</hi> as the <hi>ſame</hi> with <hi>Hell,</hi> and we meet in this ſhort Prayer with all the <hi>Terms</hi> by which <hi>Hell</hi> is deſcribed to us in the <hi>word of God;</hi> ſo that there is no danger of our miſtaking the <hi>ſenſe</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> about <hi>Purgatory,</hi> ſince we find it ſo plainly ſet forth in her <hi>Office</hi> for the <hi>Souls</hi> in <hi>it,</hi> as a <hi>Place</hi> of <hi>Fiery Torments.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>However to put this thing without the poſſibility of a <hi>Reply;</hi> that the <hi>Compiler</hi> may ſee that it is not I alone who gather thus much out of that Prayer, I will give the Reader an account of <hi>Cardinal Capiſucchi</hi>'s Opinion in his 5<hi rend="sup">th</hi>

               <p>The <hi>Cardinal</hi> firſt puts down the <hi>Opinion</hi> of <hi>them</hi> who look upon that <hi>Prayer as offer'd up for thoſe that are in Hell, who may come to be deliver'd thence as</hi> Trajan <hi>the Heathen Emperour is ſaid to have been:</hi> but <hi>This</hi> he refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes as moſt falſe and erroneous upon the reaſons com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly given in this Caſe.

               <p>Here is the <hi>Interpretation</hi> of a <hi>Great Cardinal</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> now <hi>alive,</hi> and which is more, the <hi>Chief Licenſer</hi> of all <hi>Divinity Books</hi> at <hi>Rome,</hi> as <hi>Maſter of the ſacred Palace;</hi> one of the qualifications for which place certainly is to underſtand the Faith and <hi>Doctrines</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome.</hi> Here we meet with him ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaining that <hi>Prayer</hi> in the <hi>Maſs</hi> for the <hi>Dead,</hi> as rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:94813:58"/>to <hi>Purgatory,</hi> and calling it over and over again a <hi>place</hi> of <hi>Torment, Purgatory-Fire,</hi> and declaring it to be the <hi>ſame</hi> with <hi>Hell-Fire.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I took the pains to peruſe and tranſcribe that large paſſage about the <hi>Expoſition</hi> of this <hi>Prayer</hi> hither, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I could not call it to mind without a ſecret Indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, that this <hi>Cardinal Capiſucchi,</hi> but two years be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Printing of <hi>this Book</hi> (which was not then firſt written, but Reprinted) was <hi>one</hi> of thoſe who Licen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed and ſo much commended the <hi>Biſhop</hi> of <hi>Condom</hi>'s <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition,</hi> in which we find an account of <hi>Purgatory</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly inconſiſtent with what the <hi>Cardinal</hi> had written in his <hi>Controverſies.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the Biſhop of <hi>Condom</hi>'s <hi>Expoſition,</hi> we find theſe expreſſions about <hi>Purgatory. This is what the Council of</hi> Trent <hi>propoſes to our Belief, touching the Souls detained in Purgatory, without determining</hi>
                  <note n="n" place="margin">Expoſition of the Doctrine of the Catholick Church. By the Biſhop of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,</hi> p. <hi>15.</hi>

                  <hi>in</hi> WHAT <hi>Their</hi> PAINS <hi>conſiſts, or many other ſuch like things; concerning which this holy Council demands great moderation, blaming thoſe who divulge what is uncertain or ſuſpected.

               </p>
               <p>But for all <hi>Cardinal Capiſucchi</hi>'s <hi>Licenſing</hi> and appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving this paſſage in that <hi>Expoſition,</hi> He himſelf had written the direct contrary, when he makes the <hi>Pains</hi> of <hi>Purgatory</hi> to be by <hi>Fire,</hi> and makes <hi>Hell-Fire</hi> and <hi>Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatory-Fire</hi> to be the SAME; and not only knew this to be, but publiſhed that <hi>it</hi> was the <hi>Faith</hi> of <hi>their Church</hi> that does in that <hi>Prayer</hi> for the <hi>Dead</hi> call <hi>Purgatory <hi>Hell,</hi>
                  </hi> becauſe <hi>Purgatory-Fire</hi> and <hi>Hell Fire</hi> were the <hi>very ſame.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>All the defence that can be made for <hi>Cardinal Capi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſucchi,</hi> muſt be, that the Biſhop of <hi>Condom</hi>'s words were reſtrained to the <hi>Council</hi> of <hi>Trent,</hi> which <hi>Council</hi> it is certain did not determine any thing about what
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:94813:58"/>the <hi>Purgatory pains</hi> conſiſted in; but this can by no means excuſe <hi>him,</hi> ſince it is falſe that the <hi>Biſhop</hi> of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom</hi>'s words are confin'd to that <hi>Council,</hi> for he juſt after the mention of the <hi>Council</hi> ſays, that what <hi>he</hi> had ſet down there about <hi>Satisfactions</hi> [in this World, or in <hi>Purgatory</hi>] was the <hi>innocent and holy Doctrine of the</hi> CATHOLICK CHURCH; which thing <hi>Cardinal Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſucchi</hi> did not only know in his Conſcience to be falſe, but had written the contrary to it, which I ſuppoſe he is willing ſhould be thought the truer of the two.</p>
               <p>But granting that the <hi>Biſhop</hi> of <hi>Condom</hi>'s words had been reſtrain'd wholly to the <hi>Council</hi> of <hi>Trent; Cardinal Capiſucchi</hi> ought not to have Licenſed or approved that <hi>Biſhop</hi>'s <hi>Expoſition,</hi> if he would have approved himſelf a ſincere Man: ſince he could not but know that this paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage of the <hi>Biſhop</hi> of <hi>Condom</hi> about <hi>Purgatory</hi> was a <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Juggle,</hi> and altogether unbecoming a <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> much more a <hi>Biſhop;</hi> for tho' the <hi>Council</hi> had been ſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved about the nature of the <hi>Pains</hi> in <hi>Purgatory,</hi> yet he knew too well that their <hi>Church,</hi> their <hi>Catholick Church</hi> had plainly and fully determined about the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of thoſe <hi>Purgatory Pains</hi> in <hi>her Office</hi> for the <hi>Dead,</hi> by which ſhe had ſpoken her ſenſe intelligibly enough to the very meaneſt Capacities, that <hi>thoſe pains</hi> are by FIRE, by FIRE which is the SAME with HELL-FIRE.</p>
               <p>I will urge this thing no further, but only pray to God, that thoſe great men may repent of ſuch unwar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantable actions, and of ſuch arts which are altogether a diſhonour to our <hi>Holy Religion.</hi> I think I have very fully ſhewn what I did undertake for upon this buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, to wit, that the <hi>Romiſh Purgatory is a place of <hi>Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> wherein the Souls of thoſe who are in it, undergo the ſame pains that the damned do,</hi> and <hi>that there is no other difference betwixt Hell-Fire and Purgatory-Fire, but

               <p>Having ſhewn all this ſo effectually from their <hi>ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved Writers,</hi> from the <hi>Council</hi> of <hi>Florence,</hi> from the <hi>Catechiſm ad Parochos,</hi> and from the <hi>Office</hi> for the <hi>Dead</hi> in their <hi>Romiſh Miſſal,</hi> it would be the verieſt loſs of Paper, and the greateſt affront to Readers of any ſenſe, to ſet formally here to the ſhewing how inconſiſtent this <hi>Romiſh Purgatory</hi> is with the <hi>Opinions</hi> of the <hi>Primitive Fathers</hi> about the <hi>State</hi> of the <hi>Deceaſed Faithful,</hi> whom they believed to be (when they pray'd for them) in a <hi>State</hi> of <hi>Comfort, Joy</hi> and <hi>Tranquillity;</hi> if our <hi>Compiler</hi> be not convinced alſo by what I have proved here, that there is really no more <hi>agreement</hi> betwixt their <hi>Purgatory</hi> in the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> and the <hi>State</hi> of <hi>Bliſs</hi> and <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort</hi> of the <hi>Primitive Fathers,</hi> than there is between <hi>Light</hi> and <hi>Darkneſs,</hi> betwixt Torment and Pleaſure; I muſt tell him that I will never have any further to do with an <hi>Adverſary</hi> that is obſtinate and reſolute not to be overcome; and therefore reſolved not to be perſua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded. I queſtion not but this account of <hi>Purgatory</hi> that I have given from ſuch unqueſtionable Authority in their <hi>Church,</hi> will no little diſcompoſe the <hi>Compiler,</hi> not only becauſe it will ruine all he contended for about <hi>Purgatory</hi> in his <hi>Vindication,</hi> but for a nearer concern, becauſe it ſhews, that the <hi>Compiler</hi> in giving ſuch a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary account of <hi>Purgatory</hi> in his <hi>Vindication,</hi> either did not know the <hi>Doctrine</hi> of his <hi>own Church</hi> about <hi>Purgatory,</hi> or did diſſemble it, the <hi>firſt</hi> of which makes him <hi>unable,</hi> the <hi>ſecond unfit</hi> to write about theſe things, ſince <hi>Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance</hi> or <hi>Inſincerity</hi> are ſingly ſufficient Bars againſt any Man's gaining Credit, that will notwithſtanding ſet up for a Writer.</p>
               <p>Notwithſtanding that which I have already demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted about the <hi>Romiſh Purgatory's Inconſiſtency</hi> with any <hi>Opinions</hi> of the <hi>Primitive Fathers</hi> touching the <hi>State</hi> of
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:94813:59"/>the Faithful deceaſed, ought juſtly to ſuperſede all fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Controverſie with the <hi>Compiler</hi> about <hi>Purgatory;</hi> yet ſince he offers ſomething further in Defence of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf and his <hi>Church,</hi> I will conſider it briefly. He ſays the <hi>Primitive Fathers did believe three States of Men gone off the Stage of this World,</hi> and that the <hi>middle State</hi> (to wit, of them who were neither very bad, nor very good) <hi>did ſuffer Temporal Puniſhment</hi> after their Death in order to their thorough <hi>Purgation.</hi> We enquire there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore from what <hi>Fathers</hi> he proves this, his Stock is ſmall, and S. <hi>Auſtin</hi> is his only Author for all this, whom, of all the <hi>Primitive Fathers,</hi> he ought leaſt to have inſiſted upon, ſince S. <hi>Auſtin</hi> is on every ſide, and is in for almoſt every of the different Opinions a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the State of the Dead, as I could eaſily ſhew here, were it worth while. We grant S. <hi>Auſtin</hi> did talk of <hi>three States</hi> of Men after this Life; but muſt tell our <hi>Compiler</hi> withal that S. <hi>Auſtin</hi> was the Firſt Father that begun this Diſtinction, and therefore it ought to be of no conſideration herein, eſpecially ſince it apparently contradicts the <hi>Doctrines</hi> of the Elder Fathers, who did look upon the Dead in the <hi>two Conditions</hi> only of Good Men, who were carried into <hi>Abraham</hi>'s <hi>Boſom,</hi> and Wicked Men, who were hurried into the <hi>Place of Torments.</hi> This I made ſufficiently apparent in my <hi>Anſwer</hi> to the <hi>Nubes Teſtium,</hi> particularly from S. <hi>Chryſoſtom,</hi> whoſe <hi>Third Homily</hi> upon the <hi>Epistle</hi> to the <hi>Philippians,</hi> doth evidently divide the <hi>Dead</hi> into <hi>Two States</hi> only; the <hi>Righteous</hi> whom he makes to go, imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately after they have left this world, to God, and to be poſſeſſed of Crowns and eternal Reſt; and the <hi>Wicked,</hi> whom he places among the Damned, and looks upon their Judgments alike irreverſible. But as S. <hi>Auſtin</hi> firſt talkt of <hi>Three Conditions</hi> of Men after Death, ſo we own that he talkt of <hi>Temporal Pains</hi> after this Life,
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:94813:60"/>for the middle Condition of thoſe <hi>departed Souls;</hi> yet all this will do the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> no Service for her <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatory,</hi> ſince S. <hi>Auſtin</hi> is not only ſo very doubtful about any ſuch Temporal Pains after this Life, which plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſhews it then to have been no Doctrine of the <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Church,</hi> but his <hi>Temporal Pains</hi> are wholly diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent from <hi>thoſe</hi> of the <hi>Romiſh Purgatory.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is impoſſible to expreſs any thing more doubtfully than he did this,<note place="margin">Enchiridion ad Laurentium c. 69.</note> 
                  <hi>That there may be ſuch a thing</hi> (ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of this his Notion about Temporal Pains for ſome after this Life) <hi>is not incredible, and whether it be ſo or no, it may be queſtioned, and either be found out, or lye conceal'd.</hi> And is not this a pleaſant Account of that thing for which the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> pretends to the <hi>Tradition</hi> of the <hi>Catholick Church,</hi> and told the <hi>Greeks,</hi> at the <hi>Council</hi> of <hi>Florence,</hi> that ſhe had this Doctrine delivered to her from hand to hand ſucceſſively from S. <hi>Peter</hi> and S. <hi>Paul.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But theſe Temporal Pains S. <hi>Auſtin</hi> here ſpoke of are wholly different from thoſe of the <hi>Romiſh Purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory:</hi> that the Pains of the <hi>Romiſh Purgatory</hi> are by <hi>Fire,</hi> I have juſt now proved, whereas S. <hi>Auſtin</hi>'s are no more (as is apparent from the preceding Chapter) than an <hi>intenſe Grief with which Men are afflicted or burnt</hi> for the <hi>loſs of thoſe things which they</hi>
                  <note n="o" place="margin">—Salvus eſt quidem, ſic ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men quaſi per ignem. Quia urit eum rerum dolor, quas dilexerat amiſſarum. <hi>Idem ibid. c.</hi> 68.</note> 
                  <hi>loved very much here on Earth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The laſt Argument our <hi>Compiler</hi> hath for his <hi>Purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory,</hi> which is rather inſinuated than urg'd barefac'd, is, That ſince it is allowed the <hi>Fathers</hi> did pray for the Dead, it muſt be only for them who want Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief and are in Purgation, and neither for them who are in Heaven, nor for them who are in Hell, for the <hi>former</hi> of which they are <hi>needleſs,</hi> and for the other <hi>fruitleſs.</hi> And this is what F. <hi>Alexandre,</hi> our <hi>Compiler</hi>'s <hi>Maſter,</hi> does ſpeak out plainly.</p>
               <pb n="111" facs="tcp:94813:60"/>
               <p>But to ruine this <hi>Concluſion,</hi> I will prove theſe two things, That the <hi>Fathers</hi> did pray for thoſe they belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to be in Heaven; and That, <hi>ſecondly,</hi> they prayed for thoſe in Hell.</p>
               <p>For the Proof of my firſt I will make uſe of our <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piler</hi>'s help, who brings in S. <hi>Ambroſe</hi> praying for the Soul of the <hi>Emperour Theodoſius,</hi> in his <hi>Nubes Testium,</hi> and will, I ſuppoſe, ſtill yield it me, that the <hi>Father</hi> did pray for the <hi>Emperour</hi>'s Soul. Now that S. <hi>Ambroſe</hi> did at the ſame time believe that that <hi>Emperour</hi>'s Soul was in Heaven, is evident beyond contradiction, ſince he does, in the ſame Oration, expreſly affirm that the <hi>Emperour</hi>'s Soul was <hi>then placed in the Heavenly Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem,</hi> which all People own to be Heaven it ſelf. I could prove further from the <hi>ancient Liturgies,</hi> that the <hi>Prayers</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> were made for the beſt of Men, for the <hi>Martyrs</hi> themſelves, whom they of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> ſuppoſe to be in Heaven: but I need not ſtay to do it, however I will, to take notice of that Evaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which S. <hi>Auſtin</hi> hath taught them; who looking up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it as an abſurd thing to pray for the <hi>Martyrs</hi> who were fitter to pray for us, and yet finding the Liturgies of the Church directly practiſing it, had no other way to anſwer the Practice of the Church, but by ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing (as our <hi>Compiler</hi> quotes him) that the <hi>Prayers of the Church, when put up for ſuch as Martyrs, were Thankſgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vings,</hi> but <hi>for others were a Propitiation:</hi> which with all Reverence towards S. <hi>Auſtin</hi> is a <hi>Fineneſs</hi> of too bold, and too groundleſs a Nature, ſince had the <hi>Church</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended only to praiſe God for the <hi>Martyrs,</hi> I queſtion not but ſhe would have made her Intentions plain e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, by putting down the <hi>Praiſes</hi> for the <hi>Martyrs</hi> as diſtinctly and as properly, as ſhe would the <hi>Prayers</hi> for <hi>others.</hi> I muſt not forget to prove this alſo from <hi>that Prayer in</hi> the <hi>Canon</hi> of the <hi>Maſs</hi> urged by our <hi>Compiler,</hi>
                  <pb n="112" facs="tcp:94813:61"/>wherein they pray not only for <hi>thoſe Servants of God, who have gone before them with the Seal of Faith, and reſt in the Sleep of Peace, but for</hi> ALL WHO REST <hi>in</hi> CHRIST, <hi>which does comprehend all,</hi> even <hi>Martyrs</hi> as well as <hi>Saints,</hi> or <hi>Men</hi> of <hi>Leſſer Sanctity,</hi> and as it includes <hi>Martyrs,</hi> it prays for thoſe whom the <hi>Compiler</hi> and his <hi>whole Church</hi> believe to be in Heaven. But this <hi>Prayer</hi> is no more conſiſtent with the Doctrines of the preſent Writers of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> than it is with the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent <hi>Purgatory</hi> of that <hi>Church,</hi> which ſuppoſes the <hi>Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful</hi> deceaſed to endure <hi>Fiery Torments</hi> in order to Expia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, whereas this very <hi>Old Prayer</hi> ſuppoſes them to reſt in the <hi>Sleep of Peace.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That they prayed alſo even for the <hi>Damned</hi> is plain, from S. <hi>Chryſostom,</hi> who in his above-quoted <hi>Third Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily</hi> upon the <hi>Philippians,</hi> did adviſe ſuch Prayers upon this Perſwaſion, that tho' they could not obtain a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaſe for them from Hell, yet they would procure for them ſome Alleviation of Torments, ſome ſmall Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief: and S. <hi>Austin</hi> himſelf ſeems to be for the ſame thing, when he ſpeaks of the Prayers of the Living pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiting ſo much, as <hi>either</hi>
                  <note n="p" place="margin">Aut ad hoc proſunt, ut ſit plena Remiſſio, aut certe tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rabilior fiat ipſa Damnatio. <hi>D. Auguſt. Enchirid. ad Laur. c.</hi> 110.</note> 
                  <hi>to procure a compleat and full Remiſſion, or that their Damnation ſhould be made more tolerable.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Our <hi>Compiler</hi> cavils (before he leaves this Point) ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry rudely at me for ſaying S. <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi> only adviſes the <hi>Oblation</hi> of <hi>Alms</hi> for the <hi>Increaſe of Happineſs to his Son's Soul;</hi> and does very ſcornfully ask me what means S. <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi>'s bidding him alſo pray for the <hi>diſcharge of his Son's Guilt?</hi> I can anſwer him without ſuch rude<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in a very few Words, That the <hi>Increaſe</hi> of <hi>Glory</hi> was the ſole <hi>Intention</hi> of his praying for the <hi>diſcharge of</hi> the <hi>Guilt of Sin:</hi> and that the <hi>latter</hi> was wholly deſign'd for the <hi>former.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="113" facs="tcp:94813:61"/>
               <p>Thus I have got through <hi>that Chapter</hi> about <hi>Purgatory,</hi> and have fixed all that I had proved before in my <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer</hi> to the <hi>Nubes Teſtium,</hi> that the <hi>Fathers</hi> neither knew of nor taught any <hi>ſuch Purgatory</hi> as the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> doth, and therefore ſince they believed the <hi>Romiſh Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatory</hi> no more than we of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> they are no more <hi>Papiſts</hi> than <hi>we</hi> are in this thing.</p>
               <p>When he is come to the next great <hi>Controverſy</hi> about <hi>Tranſubſtantiation,</hi> he was reſolved to divert himſelf, and his Reader, and in order to it by perverting of my ſenſe to make himſelf ſport. He pretends to be mightily at a loſs what I would have the Doctrine of our Church to be about the Euchariſt: and brings me in firſt ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>Chriſt's Body is really preſent in the Euchariſt,</hi> then <hi>that 'tis the Body of Chriſt Figuratively only,</hi> but within four lines after, <hi>that it is the Fleſh and Blood of Chriſt</hi> ABSOLUTELY, <hi>without any addition of really or figura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively:</hi> yet that in the <hi>next page 'tis not Chriſt's True Natural Body, but his Figurative or Symbolical Body.</hi> So that he ſays, <hi>I play backward and forward in declaring the Doctrine of our Church, and make the Sacrament to be really Chriſt's Body, and yet to be Figuratively only</hi> (that is, <hi>really not</hi>) <hi>his Body.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But does <hi>this Man</hi> believe himſelf in all this? Does he from his heart think that I am guilty of all this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion and contradiction about this thing? I am well enough aſſured, that no Man of the leaſt ſenſe doth find ſuch ſtuff in my <hi>Book</hi> it ſelf, and therefore that the <hi>Compiler</hi> did not, but was forc'd to abuſe my ſenſe, and falſify my words, in order to his ridiculing of them and me. For as to the firſt paſſage about <hi>Chriſt's Body being really preſent in the Euchariſt,</hi> it was occaſion'd by my telling Him, that the <hi>Controverſy</hi> betwixt the <hi>Church of England and Rome,</hi> is not about a <hi>Real Preſence,</hi> which the Church of <hi>England</hi> did believe, when ſhe looks up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:94813:62"/>the <hi>Conſecrated Elements</hi> not to be the <hi>Body</hi> and <hi>Bloud</hi> of <hi>Chriſt themſelves,</hi> but to be appointed by God to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibit to every <hi>faithful</hi> Receiver (not to every Receiver) <hi>the Body and Bloud of Chriſt.</hi> But for the Conſecrated Elements themſelves, ſhe believes them to be <hi>Figura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively only <hi>Chriſt's Body</hi>
                  </hi> and <hi>Bloud:</hi> the Reaſon of which I ſo often inculcated, becauſe BREAD and WINE CAN NO OTHERWISE BE THE BODY and BLOUD of CHRIST, AND BREAD STILL AT THE SAME TIME; and therefore our <hi>Compiler</hi> ought to bluſh at his great diſingenuity when he brings me in contradicting thoſe very words within four lines of them, and ſays, I grant there, that <hi>It</hi> (that is, the <hi>Sacrament</hi>) <hi>is the Fleſh and Bloud of Chriſt</hi> ABSOLUTELY, WITHOUT ANY ADDITION of <hi>Really</hi> or <hi>Figura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively:</hi> whereas any Man elſe would have carried my meaning along with him for ſo ſhort a way as <hi>four lines,</hi> had I ſaid ſo <hi>abſolutely, without any Addition of Really or Figuratively:</hi> but this is abſolutely falſe, for immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately after I had granted, as to <hi>Juſtin Martyr</hi>'s words, that the <hi>Conſecrated Food</hi> was the <hi>Fleſh and Bloud of Chriſt,</hi> to prevent any ſuch miſinterpretation of my words, as the <hi>Compiler</hi> would make notwithſtanding it, I added theſe very words: <hi>However to corroborate what we ſaid above</hi> [which was, that the <hi>Bleſſed Bread is the Fleſh of Chriſt,</hi> but <hi>Figuratively only</hi>] <hi>it is evident to a Demonſtration, that This Conſecrated Food</hi> was <hi>ſtill Bread,</hi> and NOT TRANSUBSTANTIATED <hi>into the Natural Body and Bloud of Chriſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Did I here then ſay it was the <hi>Fleſh of Chriſt abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely,</hi> without any Reſtriction or Explication of my words and ſenſe? Is this the Candour that becomes a Scholar? Is this the Sincerity that becomes a Chriſtian? Is this the Veracity of a <hi>Prieſt</hi> of the Living God? Well, Well, If this be anſwering an <hi>Adverſary,</hi> I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:94813:62"/>it is no matter whether it be true or falſe which we write, nor whether it be right or wrong which we aſſert, ſo that we ſecure our main deſign of ridiculing or abuſing our Adverſary.</p>
               <p>That I might ſtate the <hi>Controverſy</hi> betwixt <hi>us</hi> and <hi>Rome</hi> aright in this great point, I ſhewed our Compi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler that it was whether upon Conſecration the Bread and Wine were tranſubſtantiated into that very Body and Bloud of Chriſt which was nail'd and pour'd out upon the Croſs, or whether after Conſecration there is no other ſubſtance there but the Natural Body and Bloud of Chriſt. This I told him we expect they ſhould prove, and that it is to no purpoſe to bring us only paſſages of the <hi>Fathers</hi> to ſhew, that they gave to the Conſecrated Elements the Name and Appellation of the Body and Bloud of Chriſt, and that they ſaid of the Elements, that they were Conſecrated, made, or turned into the Body and Bloud of Chriſt, ſince we can demonſtrate to them, that by the Body and Bloud of Chriſt which the Fathers ſaid the Elements were made, they meant always <hi>that Body</hi> of Chriſt, which (in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiſtinction to his <hi>Natural Body</hi> which he took from the <hi>Virgin Mary,</hi> and his <hi>Myſtical Body,</hi> which is his <hi>Church</hi>) we call <hi>Chriſt's Symbolical,</hi> or <hi>Figurative Body.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And therefore Our <hi>Compiler</hi> is miſerably out in his <hi>Vindication,</hi> when he thinks to carry his Cauſe by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peating only what he had put down more at large in his <hi>Nubes Teſtium,</hi> and by ſuppoſing the very words of <hi>Body</hi> and <hi>Bloud</hi> of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> ſufficient Reply to all I had ſaid in my <hi>Anſwer</hi> to the <hi>Nubes.</hi> I did not ſay only <hi>this means,</hi> and <hi>that ſignifies only ſo</hi> and <hi>ſo,</hi> as he would repreſent me to do in anſwer to any thing that did ſeem ſtrong againſt us, but did all along give <hi>my Reaſons</hi> for ſuch things, till to repeat them further to the ſame
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:94813:63"/>Objections, would have been more tedious to the <hi>Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi> than me.</p>
               <p>He talks as if the <hi>Fathers</hi> were clearly in their poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion, and wholly on their ſide, and therefore that he need not much concern himſelf in confuting ſome un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toward paſſages out of the <hi>Fathers,</hi> urged by us againſt <hi>Tranſubſtantiation,</hi> ſince he ſuppoſes the Fathers are on their ſide, and would not contradict themſelves: elſe ſurely we ſhould find Him anſwering fairly to our Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections, as I had done to all his. But this is not the Man's way, tho' he is deſirous it ſhould be his Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries: but for himſelf he writes as if the <hi>Controverſy</hi> had not made one ſtep forwards betwixt us two.</p>
               <p>But to let the World be judge alſo what a ſort of an Adverſary he is, I will very briefly run over his firſt Teſtimonies in the <hi>Nubes,</hi> and my <hi>anſwer</hi> to <hi>them,</hi> and ſhew how <hi>He</hi> does reply. To the paſſage from S. <hi>Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natius,</hi> that the <hi>Euchariſt was the Body of Chriſt,</hi> I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered that it was, but that it could be <hi>Figuratively only ſo,</hi> ſince <hi>Bread could no otherwiſe be the Body of Chriſt and Bread ſtill;</hi> to this he makes <hi>no Reply.</hi> In Anſwer to the paſſage from the <hi>Council</hi> of <hi>Nice</hi> about <hi>not minding the Bread and Wine before us, but raiſing up our minds by Faith to conſider the Lamb of God offered by the Prieſts without ſhedding of Bloud,</hi> I ſhew'd him it meant only that <hi>Communicants ſhould by Faith repreſent to themſelves the offering of the Lamb,</hi> and that had he but tranſcribed on the reſt of that paſſage out of his <hi>Maſter Alexandre,</hi> every one would have ſeen at firſt bluſh, that <hi>by the pretious Body and Bloud of the Lamb was not meant Chriſt's Natural Body, but his Figurative only, ſince the Communicants are adviſed to take but a ſmall portion of his Body and Bloud; and that tho' it is ſenſe to talk of receiving little or much of the Elements, yet that it is not ſenſe to talk of taking a little or much of the True Natural Body of Chriſt.</hi>
                  <pb n="117" facs="tcp:94813:63"/>To all which there is no Reply: and Reaſon good, ſince there was not room for any.</p>
               <p>And when, in the next place, to explain a very ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure Paſſage in S. <hi>Hilary,</hi> I had produced a place that proved he did not believe any <hi>Annihilation</hi> or <hi>Tranſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantiation</hi> of the <hi>Elements,</hi> ſince he ſays <hi>it was Wine which they drank in the first Institution of the Eucharist,</hi> the <hi>Compiler</hi> had nothing to reply with, and therefore runs back, and makes much adoe with the <hi>obſcure Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage.</hi>
               </p>

S. <hi>Cyril,</hi> if this <hi>Compiler</hi> knew any thing of Him, does compare the Change in the <hi>Euchariſt</hi> to this in the <hi>Chriſm-Oyl,</hi> but I would feign know how the <hi>one Change</hi> does illuſtrate or prove the other; when according to the wiſe <hi>Maſters</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> the <hi>one</hi> is changed in its very Subſtance, but the <hi>other</hi> is not.

               <p>However, notwithſtanding <hi>Paſchaſius</hi>'s being in pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Poſſeſſion of <hi>that Diſcourſe, concerning the Body and Bloud of Christ,</hi> and <hi>Sirmondus</hi> and <hi>Mabillon,</hi> with the <hi>whole Church</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> (as I believe I may ſafely affirm it) looking upon it as undoubtedly <hi>his:</hi> I am very well ſatisfied that <hi>this Tract</hi> is <hi>Rabanus Maurus</hi>'s, and that <hi>Paſchaſius</hi> has no Right at all to it, and will give the <hi>Reader</hi> the Reaſons of that my Perſwaſion.

               <p>Another Argument I have againſt <hi>Paſchaſius</hi>'s being the Author of this <hi>Tract,</hi> and for <hi>Rabanus,</hi> taken from the <hi>Doctrine</hi> of the <hi>Diſcourſe</hi> it ſelf; which will fully diſpatch the <hi>Controverſie.</hi> It is as known a thing that <hi>Rabanus Maurus</hi> did hold, that the <hi>Sacramental Body</hi> of <hi>Chriſt</hi> was <hi>different</hi> from the <hi>Body</hi> which <hi>he</hi> took from <hi>Mary,</hi> as that <hi>Paſchaſius Radbertus</hi> did hold, that <hi>they</hi> were <hi>both</hi> the <hi>very ſame.</hi> This we learn from the <hi>MS.</hi> of an <hi>Anonymus</hi> (which <hi>Mabillon</hi> hath ſince found out to be <hi>Herigerus Abbot</hi> of <hi>Lob</hi>) concerning the <hi>Opinions</hi> of <hi>theſe very men,</hi> in <hi>Sidney College Library in Cambridge:</hi> which tells us, that <hi>Paſchaſius Radbertus Abbot</hi> of <hi>Corbey, doth lay down from S.</hi> Ambroſe, <hi>that the Fleſh of Chriſt which is received from the Altar, is altogether no other than that which was born of the Virgin</hi>

                  <hi>Rabanus</hi> in the 41. <hi>ch.</hi> of this <hi>Tract</hi> according to us (which is but the 15<hi rend="sup">th</hi> in <hi>Sirmondus</hi>'s <hi>Edition</hi>) ſays in Explication of our <hi>Saviour's words, Take and Drink of this All of you, as well Miniſters as the reſt of the Believers.</hi> This Doctrine being expreſly againſt their taking the <hi>Cup</hi> from the <hi>Laity, Sirmondus</hi> is very hard put to it in his Notes about it, and tells us, that <hi>John of Louvain,</hi> and <hi>Bellarmine and others, think the place is abuſed; and that inſtead of, Drink ye, it ſhould be read, Eat ye;</hi> well it ſhall be ſo to pleaſe <hi>thoſe men;</hi> and now let's ſee how the period will run, <hi>Take and Eat ye all of this, as well the reſt of the Faithful as the Miniſters, This is the Cup of my Bloud of the New and Eternal Teſtament,</hi> which is very pleaſant ſtuff, and therefore <hi>Sirmondus</hi> looking upon this emendation as too bold and unreaſonable, has a better way to ſolve the difficulty, and that is, <hi>that the reſt of the Faithful do indeed drink the Bloud of the Lord, but that they did not do it under the Species of Wine, but under the Species of Bread,</hi> by <hi>concomitancy,</hi> ſince <hi>they do not receive a Bloudleſs Body.</hi>

               <p>But to expoſe the <hi>violence</hi> of ſuch an <hi>Interpretation</hi> of <hi>Rabanus's words,</hi> and to let all ſee how forced <hi>this is,</hi> we need only appeal to <hi>this Chapter</hi> it ſelf, nay, to the <hi>bare Title</hi> it ſelf (which I am afraid <hi>Sirmondus</hi> did for that reaſon omit) which tells us, <hi>that we do receive and offer</hi>

               </p>
               <p>I need make no Apology for this large Digreſſion, ſince it is a Juſtice we owe to the Memories of thoſe who did oppoſe <hi>Tranſubstantiation,</hi> when it was firſt ſtarted into the World, and ſince it diſarms our Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries of One Weapon, which they uſe to employ againſt us, tho' it was really intended, by the Author of it, for us: but I did it chiefly becauſe of that popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Argument ſo often in their mouths, which they uſe when ever they are urged with any Paſſage out of the <hi>Fathers,</hi> or <hi>Church-Writers</hi> againſt their <hi>Tranſubstantia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi> We grant, cry they, that this Argument looks very promiſing for you, but, notwithſtanding this, the <hi>Father</hi> is conſiſtent with himſelf, and certainly for us, and was always lookt upon to be ſo: we'll give you an Inſtance of it, no Body hath written things ſo plauſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for you, and which, at firſt bluſh, ſeem ſo perfectly inconſiſtent with <hi>Tranſubſtantiation,</hi> as <hi>Paſchaſius Rad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertus</hi> himſelf, in his <hi>Treatiſe about the Body and Bloud of our Lord,</hi> and yet who ever doubted that <hi>Paſchaſius</hi> was of the contrary Opinion, and the <hi>greatest Man</hi> for <hi>Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſubstantiation</hi> the <hi>Church</hi> ever had?</p>
               <p>Thus we ſee what Feats may be done meerly by the ſuppoſing <hi>this,</hi> and <hi>ſuch Books,</hi> to belong to <hi>Paſchaſius,</hi> and ſuch as he, and how they carry the Cauſe, by look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon <hi>this Book</hi> to be certainly <hi>Paſchaſius Radbertus</hi>'s. For which very Reaſon, and that mentioned above, I have taken ſome pains here effectually to prove, that <hi>this Treatiſe</hi> was moſt certainly none of <hi>Paſchaſius Radber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi>'s, but does certainly belong to <hi>Rabanus Maurus,</hi> the <hi>True Author</hi> of it.</p>

               <p>It is high time to return to my Friend, the <hi>Compiler,</hi> and the Buſineſs of <hi>Tranſubstantiation,</hi> and ſee whether he makes a better Defence for the reſt of his <hi>Fathers</hi> for <hi>Tranſubstantiation,</hi> than for thoſe hitherto. To the reſt of his Quotations, from <hi>Gregory Nyſſen,</hi> I ſhewed him that that <hi>Father</hi> does compare the Changes of the <hi>Water</hi> in <hi>Baptiſm,</hi> and the <hi>Oyl</hi> in <hi>Chriſm,</hi> and the <hi>Altar</hi> at <hi>its Dedication</hi> to <hi>that</hi> of the <hi>Bread</hi> and <hi>Wine</hi> in the <hi>Eucharist:</hi> which plainly ſhews he meant no more Change of the Subſtance of any <hi>one</hi> of <hi>theſe,</hi> than of the <hi>rest.</hi> What he ſays to this is nothing but confuſion, I did not only prove that the <hi>Water</hi> and the <hi>Oyl</hi> have a <hi>Virtue</hi> from <hi>Chriſt,</hi> but that the <hi>Father</hi> ſaid <hi>they were changed</hi> as well as the <hi>Bread</hi> and <hi>Wine,</hi> ſo that if the <hi>Change</hi> of the <hi>Bread</hi> and <hi>Wine</hi> was more than a Change of Uſe and Quality only, theirs muſt be ſo too, ſince he makes them all the <hi>very ſame:</hi> and it is too childiſh to urge that he does not ſay the <hi>Water</hi> and <hi>Oyl are changed into the Body of Chriſt,</hi> ſince we do ſee he aſſerts the <hi>ſame Change</hi> in them all: and what matters it that <hi>he</hi> does not determine in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>what?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He hopes next to ſecure S. <hi>Chryſoſtom,</hi> by ſaying, that I would fain <hi>evacuate all the plain and poſitive Teſtimonies of that Father, by a doubtful and obſcure Paſſage out of his Epiſtle to</hi> Caeſarius. But I have too fully ſhewn in my Anſwer to repeat it here, That <hi>thoſe Teſtimonies</hi> from <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi> were not <hi>plain,</hi> but very <hi>Allegorical,</hi> and not <hi>poſitive</hi> but very <hi>Rhetorical,</hi> as reaſonable People of their own ſide, muſt own, that conſider them. And for the <hi>Paſſage</hi> from <hi>Caeſarius,</hi> I urged that alone againſt them, becauſe it was ſo <hi>very plain</hi> and ſo <hi>poſitive</hi> againſt <hi>Tranſubstantiation,</hi> and I will be judged by the <hi>Reader</hi> whether I needed (tho' I eaſily could have done it, and was prepared) to add any other Evidence to <hi>It,</hi> which
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:94813:69"/>runs thus. <hi>For as</hi> [in the <hi>Eucharist</hi>] <hi>before the Bread is conſecrated, we call it Bread; but after that by the Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Priest, the Divine Grace hath ſanctified it, it is no longer called Bread, but is honoured with the</hi> NAME <hi>of our</hi> LORD'S BODY, THO' THE NATURE OF BREAD CONTINUE IN IT STILL. I cannot diſcommend the <hi>Compiler</hi> for calling it <hi>obſcure,</hi> ſince it is the eaſier way to get rid of it, by ſaying ſo of it, than by an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwering it.</p>
               <p>To his Quotation from S. <hi>Ambroſe</hi> I anſwered fairly, by ſhewing him that S. <hi>Ambroſe,</hi> when he was at the height of his Illuſtrations from Scripture, to prove a <hi>Change</hi> in the <hi>Sacrament,</hi> doth yet not only compare the <hi>Change</hi> in the <hi>Eucharist</hi> to the <hi>Change</hi> of a <hi>Man</hi> by <hi>Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm,</hi> which every one owns is meerly a <hi>Change</hi> in <hi>Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,</hi> but doth poſitively aſſert, That the <hi>Elements</hi> were <hi>what they were before Conſecration,</hi> notwithſtanding <hi>their Change</hi> into <hi>another thing;</hi> which Paſſage the <hi>Compiler</hi> dare not meddle with, but only ſays, <hi>I give the pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Authority of this Father againſt them.</hi> But this is all the Man is able to ſay, and this is his way of trifling, when he hath nothing to anſwer fairly with. Whereas the <hi>Paſſage</hi> I quote is in the very ſame Book ſome of his own Quotations are taken from, and <hi>ſome</hi> of his <hi>Church</hi> were ſo ſenſible, that the Paſſage I make uſe of, is direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly againſt their <hi>Tranſubstantiation,</hi> that they have ſtruck part of it out of their <hi>Edition</hi> of S. <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broſe</hi> at <hi>Rome</hi>

               <p>In Anſwer to the <hi>Chapter</hi> about <hi>Images,</hi> he offers not <hi>one Word,</hi> but refers the <hi>Reader</hi> and me, to a <hi>whole Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe</hi> (as he calls it) <hi>which he had publiſhed in Defence of that Chapter:</hi> But why muſt we be turn'd off to an <hi>Anſwer</hi> to a <hi>Third Perſon?</hi> Is all I have laid to the <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piler</hi>'s Charge anſwered there? If it be not, To what Purpoſe am I ſent thither? Well! To comply with this <hi>ſhuffling Adverſary,</hi> I did look there, and all that I found was, that he can treat much Worthier Perſons than I pretend to be, in the moſt contemptuous Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner.

               <p>I have thus got through my <hi>Vindication</hi> of my ſelf, and which I value much more, of the <hi>Primitive Fathers,</hi> and have made it further appear how far they were from joining with, or countenancing <hi>any</hi> of thoſe <hi>Practices</hi> or <hi>Doctrines</hi> of the <hi>Church of Rome,</hi> ſet down by our <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piler</hi> in his <hi>Nubes Teſtium.</hi> As to the <hi>Supremacy</hi> of the <hi>Pope,</hi> I had little to anſwer, ſince the <hi>Compiler</hi> had ſo little to ſay in his <hi>Vindication</hi> for it, but was forc'd to leave almoſt all I had urged from the <hi>Fathers</hi> againſt it, without once touching it, but only pickt at a place here and there. <hi>One</hi> of his little touches at me I had like to have ſlipt, I know not how, over; his ſaying, <hi>I impoſe ſillily upon the Reader, when</hi> in <hi>anſwer</hi> to the <hi>Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection</hi> made about <hi>no one's denying the Biſhop of</hi> Rome<hi>'s power of Excommunicating the Aſiaticks,</hi> I had ſaid, <hi>Every Biſhop might deny to communicate with any other Biſhop or Church, againſt whom they had ſufficient reaſon: As if</hi> (ſays he) <hi>denying to communicate were the ſame thing as to Excommunicate, to the doing of which an Authority or Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdiction over them who are Excommunicated is required, whilſt refuſing Communion may be done without any ſuch power.</hi> Well then <hi>this Man</hi> ſhall have his Will, and I therefore tell him, that by <hi>denying Communion,</hi> I meant
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:94813:71"/>a doing it <hi>authoritatively,</hi> that is, a putting the <hi>other Biſhop</hi> from <hi>them</hi> by <hi>Eccleſiaſtical Cenſure:</hi> but I muſt alſo tell him, that <hi>an Authority</hi> or <hi>Juriſdiction <hi>over the perſons</hi>

               <p>So that I ſuppoſe I ſhall hear no more of my impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing ſillily about this thing, nor the <hi>Compiler</hi> have any thanks for his untoward Obſervation.</p>
               <p>Such little things will not ſerve to build that <hi>Supre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy</hi> upon, which is pretended to by the <hi>Biſhops</hi> of <hi>Rome.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And as the <hi>Primitive Fathers</hi> neither knew of, nor believed, nor therefore could ſubmit to <hi>any Supremacy</hi> of the <hi>Biſhop</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> for the <hi>firſt ſix Centuries,</hi> ſo they were as far from the <hi>Romiſh Doctrines</hi> about <hi>Tradition,</hi> grounding <hi>all Matters of Faith,</hi> as we do, upon the <hi>Holy Scriptures;</hi> and were as far from <hi>Invocating Saints</hi> as <hi>we</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> and from the <hi>Belief</hi> of <hi>Purgatory</hi> or <hi>Tranſubſtantiation,</hi> and did deteſt the <hi>Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip</hi> of <hi>Images</hi> and <hi>Reliques</hi> as much as <hi>we</hi> can; ſo that ſince in <hi>all theſe Points</hi> their <hi>Doctrines</hi> were <hi>contrary</hi> to the <hi>Doctrines</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> and their <hi>Practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces</hi>
                  <pb n="134" facs="tcp:94813:72"/>contrary to the preſent <hi>Practices</hi> of that <hi>Church,</hi> we are bound to vindicate <hi>them</hi> to the world, and to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form our <hi>Readers</hi> that <hi>they</hi> were no more <hi>Papiſts</hi> as to <hi>thoſe Points</hi> mentioned by the <hi>Compiler</hi> in his <hi>Nubes Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtium,</hi> than <hi>we</hi> of the <hi>Reformation</hi> are: and therefore I have Reaſon to conclude my <hi>Defence,</hi> as I did my <hi>laſt Book</hi> againſt the <hi>Nubes,</hi> with aſſerting it upon further Reaſons, That <hi>the Primitive Fathers were no Papiſts.</hi>
